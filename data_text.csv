"from darin johnson subject re harrassed at work could use some prayers organization cse dept u c san diego lines well i ll email also but this may apply to other people so i ll post also i ve been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs i m female yesterday i counted and realized that on seven different occasions i ve been sexually harrassed at this company i dreaded coming back to work today what if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question your boss should be the person bring these problems to if he she does not seem to take any action keep going up higher and higher sexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated and it can be an enormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that they are trying to do something about it if you feel you can not discuss this with your boss perhaps your company has a personnel department that can work for you while preserving your privacy most companies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety does seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs it is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not it is not inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee problems strife even after eight years it s a miracle if they do notice perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of higher ups if the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the entire problem there may be a state agency willing to fight with you check with a lawyer a women s resource center etc to find out you may also want to discuss this with your paster priest husband etc that is someone you know will not be judgemental and that is supportive comforting etc this will bring a lot of healing so i returned at only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch they left at or so no one could be bothered to call me at the other building even though my number was posted this happens to a lot of people honest i believe it may seem to be due to gross insensitivity because of the feelings you are going through people in offices tend to be more insensitive while working than they normally are maybe it s the hustle or stress or i ve had this happen to me a lot often because they didn t realize my car was broken etc then they will come back and wonder why i didn t want to go this would tend to make me stop being angry at being ignored and make me laugh once we went off without our boss who was paying for the lunch for this reason i hope good mr moderator allows me this latest indulgence well if you can t turn to the computer for support what would we do signs of the computer age in closing please don t let the hateful actions of a single person harm you they are doing it because they are still the playground bully and enjoy seeing the hurt they cause and you should not accept the opinions of an imbecile that you are worthless much wiser people hold you in great esteem darin johnson luxury in my day we had to make do with bytes of swap",2

"from virgilio dean b velasco jr subject re the arrogance of christians organization case western reserve univ cleveland ohio usa lines in article steve hayes writes a similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are jehovah s witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood transfusion the doctor s efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood transfusion could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as christians could be perceived to be arrogant the truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood transfusion is necessary to save the life of the child is irrelevant here what matters is that the doctor believes it to be true and could be seen to be trying to foce his beliefs on the parents and this could well be perceived as arrogance let me carry that a step further most doctors would not claim to be infallible indeed they would generally admit that they could conceivably be wrong e g that in this case a blood tranfusion might not turn out to be necessary after all however the doctors would have enough confidence and conviction to claim out of genuine concern that is is necessary as fallible human beings they must acknowledge the possibility that they are wrong however they would also say that such doubts are not reasonable and stand by their convictions virgilio dean velasco jr department of electrical eng g and applied physics cwru graduate student roboticist in training and q wannabee bullwinkle that man s intimidating a referee my boss is a not very well he doesn t look like one at all jewish carpenter",5

"from benedikt rosenau subject re a visit from the jehovah s witnesses organization technical university braunschweig germany lines in article writes didn t you say lucifer was created with a perfect nature yes define perfect then i think you are playing the usual game here make sweeping statements like omni holy or perfect and don t note that they mean exactly what they say and that says that you must not use this terms when it leads to contradictions i m not trying to play games here but i understand how it might seem that way especially when one is coming from a completely different point of view such as atheism take your foot out of your mouth i wondered about that already when i was a catholic christian the fact that the contradiction is unresolvable is one of the reasons why i am an atheist believe me i believed similar sentences for a long time but that shows the power of religion and not anything about its claims now god could have prevented lucifer s fall by taking away his ability to choose between moral alternatives worship god or worship himself but that would mean that god was in error to have make lucifer or any being with free will in the first place exactly god allows evil an evil if there ever was one now that s an opinion or at best a premise but from my point of view it is not a premise which is necessary true specifically that it is an evil to allow evil to occur it follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used letting evil happen or allowing evil to take place in this place even causing evil is another evil but could you give a definition of free will especially in the presence of an omniscient being will is self determination in other words god created conscious beings who have the ability to choose between moral choices independently of god all will therefore is free will the omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even before the omnipotent has created them there is no choice left all is known the course of events is fixed not even for the omniscient itself to extend an argument by james tims if god is omniscient then clearly creating beings with free moral choice is a greater good than the emergence of ungodliness evil sin since he created them knowing the outcome in advance why is it the greater good to allow evil with the knowledge that it will happen why not make a unipolar system with the possibility of doing good or not doing good but that does not necessarily imply doing evil it is logically possible but your god has not done it i do not know that such is logically possible if god restrains a free being s choice to choose to do evil and simply do not good then can it be said that the being truly has a free moral choice and if good is defined as loving and obeying god and avoiding those behaviors which god prohibits then how can you say that one who is not good is not evil as well like i said i am not sure that doing not good without doing evil is logically possible and when i am not omnipotent how can i have free will you have said something about choices and the scenario gives them therefore we have what you define as free will imagine the following i can do good to other beings but i can not harm them easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds but don t make them long for them so they can not feel the absence of good as evil but whose case am i arguing it is conceivable so the omnipotent can do it or it would not be omnipotent if you want logically consistent as well you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first deletion perhaps it is weak in a way if i were just speculating about the ubiquitous pink unicorns then there would be no basis for such speculation but this idea of god didn t just fall on me out of the blue or while reading science fiction or fantasy i know that some will disagree the bible describes a god who is omniscient and nevertheless created beings with free moral choice from which the definitional logic follows but that s not all there is to it there seems to be at least in my mind a certain amount of evidence which indicates that god exists and that the biblical description of him may be a fair one it is that evidence which bolsters the argument in my view that the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys the credibility of the bible nothing less and a lot of people would be interested in evidence for a god unfortunately there can t be any with these definitions benedikt",12

"from fred rice subject re ancient islamic rituals organization monash university melb australia lines in chris faehl writes in article fred rice writes deleted to get to the point therefore in a nutshell my opinion is that pre marital sex makes the likelihood of extra marital sex more probable furthermore in my opinion extra marital sex helps break down partnerships and leads to greater divorce rates this in turn in my opinion creates trauma and a less stable environment for children who are then in my opinion more likely to grow up with psychological problems such as depression etc and thus sex outside of marriage is in the long run harmful to society i think that you are drawing links where there are none having sex before marriage has nothing to do with adultery once committed into marriage the issue as i see it is more of how committed you are to not foisting pain on your spouse and how confident you are about yourself in addition what someone does within their marriage is their own business not mine and not yours i have witnessed strong relationships that incorporate extra marital sex i would agree with your assertion about children children should not be witness to such confusing relationships if adultery is stressful to adults which i assume it in general is how can we expect children to understand it where is the evidence for my opinions at the moment there are just generalities i can cite for example i read that in the th century the percentage of youth and people in general who suffer from depression has been steadily climbing in western societies probably what i was reading referred particularly to the usa similarly one can detect a trend towards greater occurrence of sex outside of marriage in this century in western societies particularly with the sexual revolution of the s but even before that i think otherwise the sexual revolution of the s would not have been possible particularly with the gradual weakening of christianity and consequently christian moral teachings against sex outside of marriage i propose that these two trends greater level of general depression in society and other psychological problems and greater sexual promiscuity are linked with the latter being a prime cause of the former i can not provide any evidence beyond this at this stage but the whole thesis seems very reasonable to me and i request that people ponder upon it why is it more reasonable than the trend towards obesity and the trend towards depression you can t just pick your two favorite trends notice a correlation in them and make a sweeping statement of generality i mean you can and people have but that does not mean that it is a valid or reasonable thesis at best it s a gross oversimplification of the push pull factors people experience my argument is mainly a proposal of what i think is a plausible argument against extra marital sex one which i personally believe has some truth my main purpose for posting it here is to show that a _plausible_ argument can be made against extra marital sex at this stage i am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or anything like that just that it is plausible to try to convince you all of this particular point of view i would probably have to do a lot of work researching what has been done in this field etc in order to gather further evidence which i simply do not have time to do now also note that i said that i think extra marital sex is a prime cause in my opinion of the generally greater levels of psychological problems especially depression in western societies i am not saying it is the prime cause or the only cause just a prime cause i e one of the significant contributions to this trend i think when you say you think my view is simplistic you have forgotten this i admit that there are probably other factors but i do think that extra marital sex and imo subsequent destabilization of the family is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like depression in western society this century fred rice",38

"from gregg jaeger subject re the inimitable rushdie re an anecdote about islam organization boston university physics department lines in article fred rice writes in article umar khan writes i just borrowed a book from the library on khomeini s fatwa etc i found this useful passage regarding the legitimacy of the fatwa it was also common knowledge as prescribed by islamic law that the sentence was only applicable where the jurisdiction of islamic law applies moreover the sentence has to be passed by an islamic court and executed by the state machinery through the due process of the law even in islamic countries let alone in non muslim lands individuals can not take the law into their own hands the sentence when passed must be carried out by the state through the usual machinery and not by individuals indeed it becomes a criminal act to take the law into one s own hands and punish the offender unless it is in the process of self defence moreover the offender must be brought to the notice of the court and it is the court who shoud decide how to deal with him this law applies equally to muslim as well as non muslim territories i agree fully with the above statement and is precisely what i meant by my previous statements about islam not being anarchist and the law not being _enforcible_ despite the _law_ being applicable hence on such clarification from the ulama islamic scholars muslims in britain before and after imam khomeini s fatwa made it very clear that since islamic law is not applicable to britain the hadd compulsory punishment can not be applied here i disagree with this conclusion about the _applicability_ of the islamic law to all muslims wherever they may be the above conclusion does not strictly follow from the foregoing but only the conclusion that the fatwa can not be enforced according to islamic law however i do agree that the punishment can not be applied to rushdie even were it well founded wow from the above it looks like that from an islamic viewpoint khomeini s fatwa constitutes a criminal act perhaps i could even go out on a limb and call khomeini a criminal on this basis certainly putting a price on the head of rushdie in britain is a criminal act according to islamic law anyhow i think it is understood by _knowledgeable_ muslims that khomeini s fatwa is islamically illegitimate at least on the basis expounded above others such as myself and others who have posted here particularly umar khan and gregg jaeger i think go further and say that even the punishment constituted in the fatwa is against islamic law according to our understanding yes gregg",45

editorial on why american doctors should care about the aids epidemic beyond the united states details several reasons for the concerted interest that all countries share in combating aids it should be noted that while aids leads in hastening global health interdependence it is not the only illness doing so diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations berkley mentions the enormous social and economic impact that aids will have on many developing countries and the increased need for international assistance that will result berkley also cites the lack of political aggressiveness toward the aids epidemic in its first decade but now there is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in approach to international health and development in general and hiv aids in particular vice president al gore proposes in his book earth in the balance a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable international development with programs to promote literacy improve child survival and disseminate contraceptive technology

endemic state even at a cost of diverting less attention to some other illnesses writes seth berkley of the rockefeller foundation in new york n y in reply to a letter by drs gellert and nordenberg although it is true that diseases other than aids such as malaria and respiratory and intestinal illnesses have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much more attention than they are getting berkley disagrees with the contention that aids is receiving too much attention hiv differs from other diseases in most developing countries because it is continuing to spread for most endemic diseases the outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another year of about the same level of needless disease and death but with aids and its increasing spread the cost of neglect not only in disease burden but financially is much greater interventions in the early part of a rampantly spreading epidemic like hiv are highly cost effective because each individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission berkley says he agrees with gellert and nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effects of aids and about the need for political leadership but he concludes that not only is assertive political leadership needed in the united states for the aids epidemic but even more so in developing countries with high rates of hiv infection

efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of hiv infected children who now face the certainty they will develop aids anthony s fauci m d director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and of the nih office of aids research said the trial is the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay disease progression in children with hiv who are not yet sick if these

funds the aids clinical trials group network anticipates conducting the trial at nine actg sites around the country and three sites participating in the actg but funded by the national institute of child health and human development preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows that certain vaccines can boost existing hiv specific immune responses and hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april stimulate new ones it will be several years however before researchers know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease the results from the pediatric trial known as actg will be examined closely for other reasons as well this trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate hiv vaccines said daniel hoth m d director of niaid s division of aids we need this information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent hiv infection in children in the united states most hiv infected children live in poor inner city areas and more than percent are minorities mainly black or hispanic nearly all hiv infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during pregnancy or at birth an infected mother in the united states has more than a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby as growing numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to hiv through injection drug use or infected sexual partners researchers expect a corresponding increase in the numbers of infected children hiv disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults the most recent information suggests that percent of infants born with hiv develop a serious aids related infection by to years of age these infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of childhood that can result in seizures pneumonia diarrhea and other symptoms leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays at least half of the children in the trial will be years of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older participants all volunteers must have well documented hiv infection but no symptoms of hiv disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen liver or spleen they can not have received any anti retroviral or immune regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the

mcnamara m d medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of niaid s division of aids we will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children for any side effects to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or fevers for example than another said dr mcnamara we ll also look at whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other significant laboratory or clinical effects he emphasized that the small study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april products the trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from recombinant hiv proteins these so called subunit vaccines each genetically engineered to contain only a piece of the virus have so far proved well tolerated in ongoing trials in hiv infected adults one vaccine made by microgenesys inc of meriden conn contains gp a protein that gives rise to hiv s surface proteins plus alum

dental research there is new evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus can cause disease independently of its ability to suppress the immune system say scientists at the national institues of health they report that hiv itself not an opportunistic infection caused scaling skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for hiv although the hiv genes were active in the mice they did not compromise the animals immunity the researchers found this led them to conclude that the hiv itself caused the skin disease our findings support a growing body of evidence that hiv can cause disease without affecting the immune system said lead author dr jeffrey kopp of the national institute of dental research nidr dr kopp and his colleagues described their study in the march issue of aids research and human retroviruses developing animal models of hiv infection has been difficult since most animals including mice can not be infected by the virus to bypass this problem scientists have developed hiv transgenic mice which carry genes for hiv as well as their own genetic material nidr scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting hiv genes into mouse eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice the resulting litters contained both normal and transgenic animals institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of hiv genetic material in l those mice however became sick and died too soon after birth to study in depth in the present study the scientists used an incomplete copy of hiv which allowed the animals to live longer some of the transgenic animals developed scaling wart like tumors on their necks and backs other transgenic mice developed thickened crusting skin lesions that covered most of their bodies resembling psoriasis in humans no skin lesions developed in their normal non transgenic littermates studies of tissue taken from the wart like skin tumors showed that they were a type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma although the papillomavirus can cause these skin lesions laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the animals tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the presence of a protein producing molecule made by the hiv genetic material hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april evidence of hiv protein production proved that the viral genes were turned on or active said dr kopp the scientists found no evidence however of compromised immunity in the mice no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common infections the fact that hiv genes were active but the animals immune systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the skin lesions dr kopp said further proof of hiv gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light the light increased hiv genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin papilloma formation in response to increased hiv genetic activity proved the genes were responsible for the skin condition the scientists said no lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the uv light the transgenic mice used in this study were developed at nidr by dr peter dickie who is now with the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases collaborating on the study with dr kopp were mr charles wohlenberg drs

the service is funded by the health resources and services administration and operates out of san francisco general hospital secretary shalala said one goal of this project is to share expertise so patients get the best care a second goal is to get more primary health care providers involved in care for people with hiv or aids which reduces treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and community social support networks currently many providers refer patients with hiv or aids to specialists or other providers who have more experience secretary shalala said this clinical expertise should be especially helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with hiv or aids in communities and clinical sites where hiv expertise is not readily available the telephone number for health care professionals is and it is accessible from a m to p m est a m to p m pst monday through friday during these times consultants will try to answer questions immediately

service to ask any question related to providing hiv care including the latest hiv aids drug treatment information clinical trials information subspecialty case referral literature searches and other information the service is designed for health care professionals rather than patients families or others who have alternate sources of information or materials when a health care professional calls the new service the call is taken by either a clinical pharmacist primary care physician or family nurse practitioner all staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and inpatient primary care for people with hiv related diseases the consultant asks for patient specific information including cd cell count current medications sex age and the patient s hiv history this national service

"from opirg subject re is msg sensitivity superstition keywords msg glu organization carleton university ottawa canada lines in article steve dyer writes in article opirg writes there has been no hard info provided about msg making people ill that s the point after all why don t you just look it up in the merk or check out the medical dictionary cite which a doctor mentioned earlier in this thread that s because these peer reviewed studies are not addressing the effects of msg in people they re looking at animal models you can t walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in humans note that i wouldn t have any argument with a statement like noting that animal administration has pro duced the following blah blah we must be careful about its use in humans this is precisely not what you said among others see olney s excitotoxic food aditives relevance of animal studies to human safety neurobehav toxicol teratol vol i m sure peta would love to hear your arguments tests have been done on rhesus monkeys as well i have never seen a study where the mode of administration was intra ventricular the glu and asp were administered orally some studies used iv and sc intra ventricular is not a normal admin method for food tox studies for obvious reasons you must not have read the peer reviewed works that i referred to or you would never have come up with this brain injection bunk it most certainly is for neurotoxicology you know studies of glutamate involve more than food science whose talking about food science what is this comment supposed to mean neurotoxicology and tratology brain research nature progress in brain research all fine food science journals pardon me but where are you getting this from have you read the journals have you done a thorough literature search so point us to the studies in humans please i m familiar with the literature and i ve never seen any which relate at all to olney s work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons then you would know that olney himself has casually referred to chinese restaurant syndrome in a few articles why don t you point us to some studies maybe then this exchange could be productive the point is exceeding the window of course they re amino acids note that people with pku can not tolerate any phenylalanine well actually they have to tolerate some phenylalanine it s a essential amino acid they just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood they re unable to metabolise it olney s research compared infant human diets specifically the amount of freely available glu in mother s milk versus commercial baby foods vs typical lunch items from the standard american diet such as packaged soup mixes he found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four fold in a single meal of processed foods mother s milk was well below the effective dose goodness i m not saying that it s good to feed infants a lot of glutamate supplemented foods it s just that this projected safety margin is a construct derived from animal models and given that you can prove anything you like we re talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here yet you re misrepresenting it as received wisdom who said anything about received wisdom there is no question that orally administered doses of msg are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence these areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism humans are vertebrates now what pray tell do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary anh and me of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease albeit indirectly of estradiol and testosterone how do you expect anyone to do the studies on this it s unethical to sacrifice humans to check out what effects chronic acute etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans the food industry knows this that s why the animal model is used in medicine and psych if you re talking about straight sensitivity it would be useful to define the term there are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology i suspect we may be arguing about separate things only adult sensitivities you and late occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults me certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young but the additivity of glu and asp and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods jointly and their hidden presence in hvp necessitates extreme caution why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults the main point is blood levels attained and oral doses would likely have to be greater than sc between who over what i would be most interested in seeing you provide peer reviewed non food industry funded citations to articles disputing that msg has no effects whatsoever you mean asserting you re being intellectually dishonest or just plain confused because you re conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other olney s reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants but that s not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of msg in most foods nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvious reasons it says nothing about msg s contribtion to the phenomenon of the chinese restaurant syndrome it says nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal reports of msg sensitivity in the lab olney s work provides a putative causal mechanism for some sensitivities terry epelbaum and martin have shown that orally administered msg causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in adults glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic gh secretion and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to msg gh is responsible not only for control of growth during development but also converts glycogen into glucose could this be the cause of headaches i don t know hmm com

"from joseph h buehler subject re sspx schism organization none lines larry l overacker writes responding to simon i may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net my understanding is that sspx does not consider itself in schism or legitimately excommunicated but that s really beside the point what does the roman catholic church say excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication as provided for in canon law here s some of the theology involved for the interested there is confusion over this issue of the sspx s schism often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between true obedience false obedience disobedience schism take the various classifications of obedience first there are important elements involved here for my purposes a command the response made to the command as far as the command goes commands can be legitimate such as the pope ordering catholics to not eat meat on fridays or they can be illegitimate such as the pope ordering catholics to worship the god dagon when every other full moon comes around as far as the response to a command goes it can be to refuse to do what is commanded or to comply making a table there are thus possibilites command response name legitimate comply true obedience illegitimate refuse true obedience legitimate refuse disobedience illegitimate comply false obedience so now you see where my classifications of obedience come from obedience is not solely a matter of compliance refusal the nature of the commands must also be taken into account it is not enough to consider someone s compliance or refusal and then say whether they are obedient or disobedient you also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad in my example if the pope commands all catholics to worship the god dagon and they all refuse they aren t being disobedient at all as far as the society of saint pius x goes they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the pope desires but that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them disobedient you also have to consider the nature of the papal desires and there s the rub sspx says the popes since vatican ii have been commanding certain very bad things for the church the popes have of course disagreed so where are we are we in another arian heresy complete with weak popes or are the sspx priests modern martin luthers well the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what and what the traditional teaching of the church is the problem here is that very few catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on and what the issues are the religion of american catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth you will never read about the issues being discussed in the catholic press in this country on the other hand one italian catholic magazine i get days has had interviews with the superior general of the society of saint pius x many catholics will decide to side with the pope there is some soundness in this because the papacy is infallible so eventually some pope will straighten all this out but on the other hand there is also unsoundness in this in that in the short term the popes may indeed be wrong and such catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they re wrong in fact if the situation is grave enough they sin in obeying him at the very least they re wasting a great opportunity because they are failing to love christ in a heroic way at the very time that he needs this badly schism let s move on to schism what is it schism is a superset of disobedience refusal to obey a legitimate command all schismatics are disobedient but it s a superset so it doesn t work the other way around not all disobeyers are schismatics the mere fact that the sspx priests don t comply with the holy father s desires doesn t make them schismatics so what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism maybe this something else makes the sspx priests schismatics you must add this the rejection of the right to command look in any decent reference on catholic theology and that s what you ll find the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command here s what the catholic encyclopedia says for example not every disobedience is a schism in order to possess this character it must include besides the trangression of the commands of superiors denial of their divine right to command from the ce article schism is the society of saint pius x then schismatic the answer is a clear no they say that the pope is their boss they pray for him every day and that s all that matters as far as schism goes what all this boils down to is this if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections their position is a legitimate one as far as the catholic theology of obedience and schism goes they are resisting certain papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the papacy and the best interests of the church in fact someone who finds himself in this situation has a duty to resist now what is the stance of rome on all this well if you read the holy father s motu proprio ecclesia dei you can find out it s the definitive document on the subject a motu proprio is a specifically papal act it s not the product of a roman congregation a letter that the pope has possibly never even read it s from the pope himself his boss is god there s no one else to complain to in this document the holy father says among other things the episcopal consecrations performed by archbishop lefebvre constituted a schismatic act archbishop lefebvre s problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of tradtion both are confusing i fail to see the logic of the pope s points as far as the episcopal consecrations go i read an interesting article in a translation of the italian magazine si si no no it all gets back to the question of jurisdiction if episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the pope s jurisdiction then they would truly constitute a schismatic act justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law but my problem with this is this according to the traditional theology of holy orders episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction it only confers the power of order the ability to confect the sacraments jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it such as the pope the society bishops knowing the traditional theology quite well take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone they simply confer those sacraments that require a bishop the si si no no article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the pope said what he did is that he has a novel post vatican ii idea of holy orders according to this idea episcopal consecration does confer jurisdiction i lent the article to a friend unfortunately so can t tell you more i believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea the pope s thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me there s no way there is a schism according to traditional catholic theology so why does the pope think this as far as the points regarding the nature of tradition goes here s the passage in question the root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete and contradictory notion of tradtion incomplete because it does not take sufficiently into the account the living character of tradition which as the second vatican council clearly taught comes from the apostles and progresses in the church with the help of the holy spirit there is a growth in insight into the realities and words that are being passed on this comes about in various ways it comes through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts it comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which they experience and it comes from the preaching of those who have received along with their right of succession in the espiscopate the sure charism of truth but especially contradictory is a notion of tradition which opposes the universal magisterium of the church possessed by the bishop of rome and the body of bishops it is impossible to remain faithful to the tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond with him to whom in the person of the apostle peter christ himself entrusted the ministry of unity in his church papal motu proprio ecclesia dei july it seems to me that the holy father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following vatican council ii has happened i am the pope the argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that archbishop lefebvre must be wrong because he disagrees with them this is weak to say the least it would have helped clarify things more if the pope had addressed archbishop lefebvre s concerns in detail what is john paul ii s stand on the social kingship of christ as taught by gregory xvi pius ix leo xiii pius xi and pius xii for example are we supposed to ignore what all these popes said on the subject i don t know what the future will hold but the powers that be in the sspx are still talking with rome and trying to straighten things out many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey justified disobedience or even obeying god rather than man calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of alice in wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean similarly schism indicates a formal break in the church if the pope says that a schism exists it seems to me that by definition it exists it may be that the pope is on the wrong side of the break that there is no good reason for the break to exist and that it will shortly be healed but how can one deny that it does in fact exist it seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform the power of the papacy what good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the pope in the future but in the process you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline it s one thing to hold that the pope has misused his powers and excommunicated someone wrongly it s something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect and the schism is all in his imagination that means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools but acts whose validity is open to debate generally it has been liberal catholics who have had problems with the pope while they have often objected to church sanctions generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist you are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying and to be in communion while excommunicated this would seem to be precisely the denial of divine right to command that you say defines schism clh",159

is your groundless prediction that this will happen but you haven t taken into the account of propoganda remember if you asked germans before wwii if the jews shoudl be slaughtered they would probably answer no but after the propoganda machine rolled through at least some were able to tolerate it you see it only takes a small group of fanatics to whip up a general frenzy the propoganda machines have been in gear over a number of issues including abortion and gays look at some of the things that have happened well so far they have passed one amendment which is currently under intense scrutiny and they have failed to outlaw abortion which is their prime goal on that issue yep they seem sooo effective sure well they haven t managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity of the courts but they have managed to create quite a few problems for people that wanted to have an abortion they could create similar problems for us and it could be worse they can try to stop abortions by blocking clinics etc but imagine what they d have to do to stop atheism besides the margin of error is very large when you only talk to two people better than your one that is your opinion also i have

convince a whole room of them a whole nation as for the atheist portion i know some around here they have all expressed disgust with the motto some noted being harassed by christians who used the

with what could happen an what may be likely which christians designed the motto does the motto say anything about jesus why do you think that it refers only to christians christians wrote it christians think that their religion is right and all others are wrong therefore why would they include other religions in the realm of being correct i doubt that any other religions were meant to be included well i am not clear on the religious convictions of francis scott key the motto can be attributed to him but it is at least clear that he believed in a god and surely there are a few christians that think as you say but i don t think that most do do you think that all christians actively despise other religions most that i have met haven t and don t do so no christian that i have queried thinks it means anything but them and only them why not ask some people of other faiths sorry i would but christianity is just so awfully popular around here suppose you could ask a few people well i have asked a hindu moselem and a few jews and all of them think that it is applicable to them of course i can t say that these people just some that i know pretty well are accurate representations of their faiths it is always a good idea to assume that there were dissenting views on any given issue you are assuming that all the views were the same and nothing leads to this conclusion without evidence to the contrary i doubt that there were dissenting opinions you claim there were provide some evidence for your assertion well i d really like to and i ve tried but i really don t know where to get access to _congressional records_ from the s can anyone help out here comparing christians to nazis interesting only in the sense that neither can probably convinced to change their beliefs no again the motto on the money doesn t cost you anything extra however if you abolished the motto we d all have to pay to have all the dies and plates redone like people paid before to get them changed to have the motto on them you now need to show that there is a good reason to change everything again also i doubt that they use th same plates for more than a year s printing this would make it easy to remove the motto simply make next year s plates without it your claim evidently is that they will have to pay extra somewhere provide some evidence for this assertion so are you saying that they redesign the plates each year anyway your whole argument conveniently deleted i see was that the motto somehow costs us all a lot of money this is just not correct the ones i read didn t mention anything about jesus i think the issue was concerning the distinction between religion and not how could it be between religious and not religious the motto refers to god it is a religious motto the question is whether or not it is only christian you say it is more i doubt this provide some evidence for this assertion that is to say the religion of this country and the non religion of the ussr that was what most of those quotes were about and some included all atheists in general as well i don t think that any of the quotes although i seem to have lost them mentioned anything at all about jesus they advocated religion over non religion a specific religion was not mentioned you have missed this point i said that the motto didn t say anything about anyone in particular that is the motto doesn t imply anything about your particular beliefs it doesn t say that everyone trusts in some form of god only that the nation on the whole does we have been through this before it s obvious it does not include me this much is beyond doubt your claim again is that the motto refers to more than christians based on the facts that christianity says all other religions are wrong and because it seems that the motto was written by christians i doubt your claim so you are saying that all christians must believe that all other religions should be outlawed just because they think they are wrong that s silly i think the flat earthers are wrong but i don t advocate their banishment based on this idea i doubt that any additional expense would even be incurred by removing the motto provide some evidence for your claim that it would i think that any such cost would be insignificant i mentioned the slight cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by being on our currency disregarding the digression of the other motto if it is used for harassment and no other purpose has been found for it why should it not be removed well mottos in general don t really have purposes i don t think it should be removed because i think the benefit would be outweighed by the consequences and do you know what the vote was were there other opinions do you think that the main reason the motto was required by law was to bother atheists do you think that this is what the majority of congress at the time had in mind if you do then show why again it is the opinion of the people who put it there that i am concerned with then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress again it is not necessary that the complete majority shared the purpose of confronting godless communism with this motto why not it is the majority that put it there the general public probably does not know about the anti atheist intent of a few people in the s either i daresay more people remember the s than the time when key wrote the anthem but do they remember the debate surrounding the motto do they remember that some people intended it to be a message against atheists why don t you include this in your little survey that you were conducting you claim here that scientists would believe someone s claims i doubt this provide evidence for your assertion what should i ask some scientists the probability that something einstein said about relativity is worthy i mean if einstein said it there s a good chance that it was right at least at the time as for the courts the method scientists use can be applied i need not agree with the court by default because of a good record you need not agree with them all of the time but you would certainly think that their decisions would be good evidence in favor of some point what but you said you didn t agree with the court because they allowed congress to attempt to make an amendment prohibiting flag burning if you don t realize that something like this is external to the realm of the court s power then how can i be confident that you know anything about the court s powers i mean if you don t know how the court works how can you participate in a discussion of the court a judge can go to speak before congress and still you ignore the abortion gag rule as you make your claims on abortion no i think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a supreme court justice to testify before congress during the consideration of a constitutional amendment and in order for the court to rule on something a case usually must be presented mushrooms flowers trees buildings signs whatever the analogy is the same just because something that i might find offensive is present doesn t mean that my rights are being violated we are talking about something put there by people keith not a mushroom no one caused that mushroom to exist unless you re finding things offensive in a mushroom farm yes some mushrooms can be planted and i don t appreciate mushrooms on my pizza either this is not the case with the motto and you re ignoring the harassment which is the only known result of the motto and you re ignoring that somewhere along the line people were forced to put the motto there who was forced to put the motto there what do you mean keith",178

"from subject re monophysites and mike walker organization harvard university science center lines in article d andrew byler writes mike walker if you are using the standard formula of fully god and fully human that i m not sure why you object to saying that jesus was human i think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity it s a consequence of the fall jesus is human but not a fallen human clh i differ with our moderator on this i thought the whole idea of god coming down to earth to live as one of us subject to sin and death as one of the consecration prayers in the book of common prayer puts it was that jesus was tempted but did not succumb if sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity then jesus fully human nicea would not be subject to sin but then the resurrection loses some of its meaning because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin to distinguish between human and fallen human makes jesus less like one of us at the time we need him most these issues get mighty subtle when you see people saying different things it s often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things or whether they are using different terminology i don t think there s any question that there is a problem with nestorius and i would agree that the saying christ had a human form without a real human nature or will is heretical but i d like to be a bit wary about the copts armenians etc recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought nestorius was an extreme representative of one of the two major schools of thought more moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox e g theodore of mopsuestia my impression is that the modern monophysite groups inherit the entire tradition not just nestorius version and that some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as orthodox clh first the monophysites inherited none of nestorius s version they were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him second the historical record suggests that the positions attributed to nestorius were not as extreme as his successful opponents who wrote the conventional history claimed mainly nestorius opposed the term theotokos for mary arguing i think correctly that a human could not be called mother of god i mean in the athanasian creed we talk about the son uncreate surely even arians would concede that jesus existed long before mary anyway nestorius s opponents claimed that by saying mary was not theotokos that he claimed that she only gave birth to the human nature of jesus which would require two seperate and distinct natures the argument fails though because mary simply gave birth to jesus who preexisted her either divinely if you accept nestorianism as commonly defined or both natures intertwined a la chalcedon second i am not sure that nestorianism is not a better alternative than the orthodox view after all i find it hard to believe that pre incarnation that jesus s human nature was in heaven likewise post ascension i think rather that god came to earth and took our nature upon him it was a seperate nature capable of being tempted as in gethsemane since i believe the divine nature could never be tempted but in its moments of weakness the divine nature prevailed comments on the above warmly appreciated jason albert there may be differences in what we mean by subject to sin the original complaint was from someone who didn t see how we could call jesus fully human because he didn t sin i completely agree that jesus was subject to temptation i simply object to the idea that by not succumbing he is thereby not fully human i believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human i again apologize for confusing nestorianism and monophysitism i agree with you and have said elsewhere that there s reason to think that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in fact heretical there are scholars who maintain that nestorius was not nestorian i have to confess that the first time i read some of the correspondence between nestorius and his opponents i thought he got the better of them however most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to chalcedon was an advance and that nestorius was at the very least rash and dogmatic as the editor of the christological controversy refers to him in rejecting all approaches other than his own as regular usenet readers know narrowness can be just as much an impediment as being wrong furthermore he did say some things that i think are problematical he responds to a rather mild letter from cyril with a flame worthy of usenet in it he says to attribute also to the logos in the name of the incarnation the characteristics of the flesh that has been conjoined with him is my brother either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of arius and apollinaris and the others those who are thus carried away with the idea of this association are bound because of it to make the divine logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness these things are taken falsely when they are put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us who perpetrate the falsehood it s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and divinity but the whole concept of incarnation is based on exactly the idea that the divine logos does in fact have to some degree a part in being born growing up and dying of course it must be understood that there s a certain indirectness in the logos participation in these things but there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human or we don t have an incarnation at all nestorius seemed to think in black and white terms and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this area you say i find it hard to believe that pre incarnation that jesus s human nature was in heaven i don t think that s required by orthodox doctrine it s the divine logos that is eternal clh",199
"from dan johnson subject re the arrogance of christians reply to organization not sun microsystems lines in article boundary writes pixie writes deletia sig p s if you do sincerely believe that a god exists why do you follow it blindly do the words question authority mean anything to you i defy any theist to reply deletia formalities i probably should let this pass it s not worth the time and it s not really intended for me but i couldn t resist a personal weakness of mine jerkius kneeus tragically incurable the foundation for faith in god is reason without which the existence of god could not be proven that his existence can be proven by reason is indisputable cf my short treatise traditional proofs for the existence of god and summa theologica not so i can prove that the existance of god is disputable by showing that people dispute it this is easy i dispute that god exists simple i missed your traditional proofs treatise but the proofs i remember from the summa theologic the ways i think it was were rather poor stuff the ontological argument is about a billion times better imho i would think you d want non traditional proofs considering the general failure of the traditional proofs at least the ones i know of i am thinking of the ontological argument the cosmological argument and the teleological argument those are the ones traditional enough to have funny names anyway now given that god exists and that his existence can be proven by reason i assert that his commands must be followed blindly although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith why this is the real question so to discuss it i ll assume god exists otherwise there is no heavenly authority to babble about because god is the first cause of all things the first mover of matter the independent thing that requires nothing else for its existence the measure of all that is perfect and the essential being who gives order to the universe logos please show this is the case i am familiar with the first cause argument and i ll accept for the sake of argument that there is a first cause even though i find some of its premices questionable the rest you ll have to show this includes that the first cause is god i next assert that god is all good got it i deny that god is all good so there if this is so then that which is contrary to the will of god is evil i e the absence of the good and since god can never contradict himself then by his promise of a savior as early as the protoevangelium of genesis god instructs that because a human adam was first responsible for man s alienation from the source of all good a man would be required to act to restore the friendship thus god became incarnate in the person of the messiah this isn t self consistent if humans must renew the relationship then god incarnate or not can t do it well unless you think god is human granted god made himself human but this is nonetheless cheating the intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem he caused god fixing it even by indirect means contradicts this now this messiah claimed that he is the truth john if this claim is true then we are bound by reason to follow him who is truth incarnate why also why assume said claim is true anyway if i claim to be truth are you bound by reason to follow me you next seem to have a problem with authority have you tried the united states marine corps yet i can tell you first hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority undoubtably do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the marines without question you seem to imply this about god and that the marines are similar in this respect if this is not what you are trying to say they please explain what it is you are saying as i have missed it if you have not yet had the privilege i will reply that the authority which is truth incarnate may never be questioned and thus must be followed blindly why why not question it even if it is truth we can not know this certainly so why is it so irrational to question perhaps we will thus discover that we were wrong you assert that god is truth and we can t question truth but i assert that god is not truth and anyway we can question truth how is it my assertion is less good than yours one may not deny the truth oh i hereby deny i hope you ll agree is the truth granted i look pretty damn silly saying something like that but i needed something we d both agree was clearly true now you ll notice no stormtroopers have marched in to drag me off to the gulag no heaven lighting bolts either no mysterious net outages i seem to be permited to say such things absurd or not for example when the proverbial apple fell on isaac newton s head he could have denied that it happened but he did not the laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not they are true they are certainly not true at least the ones newton derived are not true and are indeed wildly inaccurate at high speeds or small distances we do not have a set of laws of physics that always works in all cases if we did physics would be over already science is all about questioning this sort of truth if we didn t we d still follow aristotle i d generalize this a little more if you want to learn anything new you must question the things you know tm because you can always be wrong therefore the authority which is truth may not be denied even presupposing that truth may not be denied and may not be questioned and that god is truth it only follows that god may not be denied or questioned not that he must be obeyed we could unquestioningly disobey him how annoying of us but you have not connected denial with disobedience dan no nickname johnson and god said jeeze this is

"from joseph h buehler subject re sspx schism organization none lines here is some material by michael davies on the subject of schism in general and archishop lefebvre in particular he wrote it around the first part of the two part article was on the scandalous activities of archbishop weakland in this country but i cut all that and i pared down the rest to what was relevant joe buehler schism and disobedience according to st thomas aquinas schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the pope or communion with the members of the church united to him on first sight it would appear that whatever the subjective motivation of the archbishop as discussed above he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction however standard catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic if this were so as was noted at the beginning of this article it would mean that the number of american bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures the distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative dictionnaire de theologie catholique the article is by father yves congar who is certainly no friend of archbishop lefebvre he explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused father congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the church for example luther s rejection of the papacy father congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience the catholic encyclopedia explains that for a catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend to sever himself from the church as far as in him lies it adds that not every disobedience is schism in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors a denial of their divine right to command not only does mgr lefebvre not deny the divine right of the pope to command but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the pope s authority and his intention of never breaking away from rome the archbishop made his attitude clear in the july august issue of days we pray for the pope every day nothing has changed with the consecrations last june we are not sedevacantists we recognize in john paul ii the legitimate pope of the catholic church we don t even say that he is a heretical pope we only say that his modernist actions favor heresy intrinsically schismatic the principal argument used by those claiming that mgr lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act a bishop who carries out such a consecration it is claimed becomes ipso facto a schismatic this is not true if such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication in the code of canon law the offence was punished only by suspension see canon of the code pope pius xii had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in china the consecration of these illicit chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by mgr lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the pope that is to deny that he has the right to govern the church and the illicitly consecrated chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission neither archbishop lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction they have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations i do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by mgr lefebvre the consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the roman pontiff but the archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the church could not be more grave and that grave measures were needed in response it appears to be taken for granted by most of the archbishop s critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism and the vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression there is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation the new code of canon law includes a section beginning with canon entitled penalties for specific offenses de poenis in singula dicta the first part deals with offenses against religion and the unity of the church de delictis contra religionem et ecclesiae unitatem canon deals with the offense of schism which is evidently together with apostasy and heresy one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the church but the archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or indeed under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church the canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of penalties for specific offenses which is entitled usurpation of ecclesial functions and offenses in their exercise de munerum ecclesiasticorum usurpatione degue delictis iniis exercendis the canon in question is canon which reads a bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic latae sententiae excommunication reserved to the holy see the scandalous attempts to smear archbishop lefebvre with the offense of schism are then contrary to both truth and charity a comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages an accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder i must stress that what i have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of canon law canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for mgr lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable father patrick yaldrini dean of the faculty of canon law of the institut catholique in paris noted in the july issue of valeurs actuelles that as i have just explained mgr lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function he added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop it is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel church cardinal rosalio lara president of the pontifical commission for the authentic interpretation of canon law commented on the consecrations in the july issue of la repubblica it would be hard to imagine a more authoritative opinion the cardinal wrote the act of consecrating a bishop without a papal mandate is not in itself a schismatic act in fact the code that deals with offenses is divided into two sections one deals with offenses against religion and the unity of the church and these are apostasy schism and heresy consecrating a bishop with a pontifical mandate is on the contrary an offense against the exercise of a specific ministry for example in the case of the consecrations carried out by the vietnamese archbishop ngo dinh thuc in and although the archbishop was excommunicated he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because there was no intention of a breach with the church it is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate archbishop lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church he is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic the archbishop considers correctly that the the church is undergoing its worst crisis since the arian heresy and that for the good of the church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his society canon law provides for just such a situation and even if one believes that the future of the society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations the fact that the archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means as canon law states clearly that he has not incurred excommunication furthermore while the vatican allows such prelates as archbishop weakland to undermine the faith with impunity it can not expect catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the church and the salvation of souls dr eric m de saventhem president of the international una voce association is one of the best informed laymen in the church and he knows the archbishop intimately dr de saventhem like myself has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between mgr lefebvre and the holy see during the archbishop s lifetime a quotation from a statement by dr de saventhem which was published in the february remnant merits careful study in retrospect the road leading to the consecrations of june appears more paved with grave roman and unfortunately also papal omissions than with lefebvrist obstinancies and from the eyes of an informed public this can not be hidden by attempting to present the archbishop s act of grave disobedience as an offense against the faith it is said today that mgr lefebvre has an erroneous concept of tradition if this were so cardinal ratzinger could not on behalf of the pope have addressed to the archbishop the following words in his letter of july your ardent desire to safeguard tradition by procuring for it the means to live and prosper testifies to your attachment to the faith of all time the holy father understands your concern and

"from robert grant subject virtual reality for x on the cheap organization uscacsc los angeles lines distribution world reply to robert grant nntp posting host cpuserver acsc com hi everyone i thought that some people may be interested in my vr software on these groups announcing the release of multiverse multiverse is a multi user non immersive x windows based virtual reality system primarily focused on entertainment research features client server based model using berkeley sockets no limit to the number of users apart from performance generic clients customizable servers hierachical objects allowing attachment of cameras and light sources multiple light sources ambient point and spot objects can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily attached functionality client the client is built around a fast render loop basically it changes things when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user s viewpoint it also provides the server with information about the user s actions which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to other users the client is designed to be generic in other words you don t need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world this means that resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it the adaptations as will be explained in a moment occur in the servers this release of the client software supports the following functionality o hierarchical objects with associated addressing o multiple light sources and types ambient point and spot o user interface panels o colour polygonal rendering with phong shading optional wireframe for faster frame rates o mouse and keyboard input some people may be disappointed that this software doesn t support the powerglove as an input device this is not because it can t but because i don t have one this will however be one of the first enhancements server s this is where customization can take place the following basic support is provided in this release for potential world server developers o transparent client management o client message handling this may not sound like much but it takes away the headache of accepting and terminating clients and receiving messages from them the application writer can work with the assumption that things are happening locally things get more interesting in the object extension functionality this is what is provided to allow you to animate your objects o server selectable extension installation what this means is that you can decide which objects have extended functionality in your world basically you call the extension initialisers you want o event handler registration when you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback functions for the events that you want the object to respond to current events supported init move change collide terminate o collision detection registration if you want your object to respond to collision events just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software your callback will be activated when a collision occurs this software is kept separate from the worldserver applications because the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects from which to choose the following is all you need to make a world server application o provide an initworld function this is where you choose what object extensions will be supported plus any initialization you want to do o provide a positionobject function this is where you determine where to place a new client o provide an installworldobjects function this is where you load the world wld file for a new client o provide a getworldtype function this is where you tell a new client what persona they should have o provide an animateworld function this is where you can go wild at a minimum you should let the objects move by calling a move function and let the server sleep for a bit to avoid outrunning the clients that s all there is to it and to prove it here are the line counts for the three world servers i ve provided generic lines dactyl lines more complicated collision detection due to the stairs will probably be improved with future versions dogfight lines location this software is located at the following site ftp u washington edu directory pub virtual worlds file multiverse tar z futures client o texture mapping o more realistic rendering i e z buffering or similar gouraud shading o hmd support o etc etc server o physical modelling gravity friction etc o enhanced object management interaction o etc etc both o improved comms i hope this provides people with a good understanding of the multiverse software unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation and i m not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified i hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the virtual universe i ve certainly found fascinating developing it and i would love to add support for the powerglove and an hmd finally one major disclaimer this is totally amateur code by that i mean there is no support for this code other than what i out the kindness of my heart or you out of pure desperation provide i can not be held responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code use it at your own

he was writting to i suppose that you would have criticised john that his gospel was to simple i ve talked with schaeffer one on one i ve been in lectures with the man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof s from secular as well as christian universities nd alone would fill both those catagories his answers were enough that the prof s themselves often were taken back and caused to re think what their question was i saw this time and time again at different open forums so yes schaeffers books are by in large well simplistic it certainly isn t grad level reading but we must get off our high horses when it comes to recommended reading do you seriously think most people would get through the first chapter of wittgenstein i may have more to say about this secular scientist at another time also one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by insistent inquisitiveness one can not live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt base look the christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality but we must add a qualification to give this balance christianity is second to none in keeping reason in its place we never know the value of a thing until we know its limits put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value this is why xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic it also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism and not christian faith which leads to irrationality if we forget the limits of a thing we fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic lesson of life more without limits is less less with limits is more or as i have so often stated it freedom without form soon becomes form w o freedom let s put it another way the rationality of faith is implacably opposed to absurdity but has no quarrel with mystery think about that it can tell the difference between the two if you will let it christianity s contention with rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it but that it has very little else when a christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust go hand in hand but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called to go on by itself without his understanding this is where the principle of suspended judgment applies at such time if the christian faith is to be itself and let god be god it must suspend judgment and say father i do not understand you but i trust you now don t read all your objections of me into that statement i wasn t saying i do not understand you at all but i trust you anyway it means that i do not understand you in this situation but i do understand why i trust you anyway therefore i can trust that you understand even though i do not the former is a mystery unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity the latter is a statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of faith so the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational it is not a leap of faith but a walk of faith as believers we can not always know why but we canalways know why we trust god who knows why and this makes all the difference now there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where i have parted company with philosophy what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit more difficult in practice in practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith like the insistent whying of a year old it isn t just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we must know what we can not know the one produces frustration because curiosity is denied the other leads to genuine anguish more specifically the poorer our understanding is in coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after coming to faith if we do not know why we trust god then we will always need to know exactly what god is doing in order to trust him failing to grasp that we may not be able to trust him for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we are able to trust if on the other hand we do know why we trust god we will be able to trust him in situations where we do not understand what he is doing too many xian leaders teach as if the christian had a window in the back of his head which allows for understanding at every foot fall for what god is doing may be ambiguous but it will not be inherently contradictory it may be mystery to us but mystery is only inscrutable what would be insufferable is absurdity and that my friend was the conclusion of nietzche both in theory and in practice rex",266

hours more than days so if you reply to this please send private email to the address i have set the reply to line to have that address but i don t know if it will work it depends upon the software but generally i wouldn t expect reply to to cause an email cc to be sent in addition to a posting you ll probably need to do something specific which will vary depending upon your news software clh at any rate i need some support much thanks to jayne k who is already supporting me with kind words and prayers i ve been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs i m female yesterday i counted and realized that on seven different occasions i ve been sexually harrassed at this company seven times eight years yesterday was the most recent one someone left an x rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer i m really upset by this i suppose it could have been worse it could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something there was no note i do not know if it was someone s idea of an innocent joke that went awry someone s sick idea of flirting an act of emotional terrorism that worked i dreaded coming back to work today what if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question i don t know the answer so i take a military specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer and out falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep i generally have a bible on my desk for occasional inspiration what if i open it up to corinthians and find a picture a la the north american man boy love association i want to throw up just thinking about this stuff i can lock up my desk but i can t lock up every book i have in the office i can t trust that someone won t shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when i m not looking so that i go home to find such a picture or a threat or a raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body to make it worse the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch the appointed hour for leaving was i was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch so i returned at only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch they left at or so no one could be bothered to call me at the other building even though my number was posted so i came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and i was the sole survivor this despite the fact that everyone knew how bad i felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer i need some prayers i can t stop crying i am so deeply wounded that it s ridiculous i feel like i m some kind of sub human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act i feel like i m a sub human piece of garbage that s not worthy of a simple phone call saying we re leaving for mary s lunch a little early so that bob can get back for a big meeting please pray that my resentments will either go away or be miraculously turned into something positive please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop and find some healing for him or herself please pray for my being healed from this latest wound which falls on top of a whole slew of other wounds please pray that i can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions this company in my opinion has pretty words about how sexual harrassment isn t tolerated but when you get right down to it how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately left obsene or threatening notes left obscene pictures spoken to lewdly etc seven times in eight years in the same place pretty words from the company do me no good when i m terrified or healing from the latest assault and please pray that i don t turn into an automaton because of this that s my bad habit ignore it and it will go away you re not worth anyone s time so don t go talking to anyone about this you re right you are a sub human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way you are just an object you prostitute your mind to this company so why can t others expect you to prostitute your body there as well what makes you think women aren t just possessions and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act this is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode please pray that these thoughts don t come into my head and stay there triggering depression please pray that this latest trauma doesn t come between me and god in a way a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to god and it s also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from god i know god doesn t drop me from his loving hand but it s awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand look down think i m falling and forget that god s still holding on to me although this probably isn t entirely appropriate for this newsgroup i really can use the kind of loving support you all provide for this reason i hope good mr moderator allows me this latest indulgence after

"from bake timmons subject re amusing atheists and anarchists lines writes my turn i went back and reread your post all you did is attack atheism and say that agnosticism wasn t as funny as atheism nowhere does that imply that you are agnostic or weak atheist as most people who post such inflammatory remarks are theists it was a reasonable assumption sorry you re right i did not clearly state it rule condescending to the population at large i e theists will not win many people to your faith anytime soon it only ruins your credibility how am i being condescending to the population at large i am stating something that happened to be true for a long time i couldn t believe that people actually believed in this god idea it was an alien concept to me i am not trying to win people to my faith as you put it i have no faith religion was a non issue when i had the attitude above because it never even occurred to me to believe atheist by default i guess you could say the most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational attitude once one has accepted the _assumption_ that there is no god s and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their assumption s contradict your assumption then i would say there s a lack of consistency here now i know you ll get on me about faith if the _positive_ belief that god does not exist were a closed logical argument why do so many rational people have problems with that logic but you probably like me seem to be a soft atheist sorry for the flamage the line about atheists haveing something up their sleeves is what seemed to imply that sorry been reading too much on the clipper project lately and the paranoia over there may have seeped in some what is the clipper project btw rule don t mix apples with oranges how can you say that the extermination by the mongols was worse than stalin khan conquered people unsympathetic to his cause that was atrocious but stalin killed millions of his own people who loved and worshipped _him_ and his atheist state how can anyone be worse than that many rulers have done similar things in the past only stalin did it when there was plenty of documentation to afix the blame on him the evidence is that some of the early european rulers ruled with an iron fist much like stalin s you threw in numbers and i am sick of hearing about stalin as an example because the example doesn t apply you managed to get me angry with your post because it appeared to attack all forms of atheism it might have appeared to attack atheism in general but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons people will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it be it cross or hammer sickle the stalin example _is_ important not only because it s still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also because people really did love him and his ideas even after all that he had wrought the evidence i am referring to is more a lack of evidence than negative evidence say i claim there are no pink crows i have never seen a pink crow but that doesn t mean it couldn t exist but this person here claims that there are pink crows even though he admits he hasn t been able to capture one or get a photo or find one with me etc in a sense that is evidence to not believe in the existence of pink crows that is what i am saying when i look at the evidence i look at the suppossed evidence for a deity show how it is flawed and doesn t show what theists want it to show and go on first all the pink crows unicorns elves arguments in the world will not sway most people for they simply do not accept the analogy why one of the big reasons is that many many people want something beyond this life you can pretend that they don t want this but i for one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes and there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a god can love as a truth be proven logically themselves namely a god or gods so in principle it s hard to see how theists are necessarily arrogant makes no sense to me they seem arrogant to make such a claim to me but my previous refutation still stands and i believe there may be another one on the net john the baptist boasted of jesus to many people i find it hard to see how that behavior is arrogant at all many christians i know also boast in this way but i still do not necessarily see it as arrogance of course i do know arrogant christians doctors and teachers as well technically you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant jesus for instance are you talking about all atheism or just strong atheism if you are talking about weak atheism which i believe in then i refuse such a claim atheism is a lack of belief i used good ol occam s razor to make the final rejection of a deity in that as i see things even if i present the hypothesises in an equal fasion i find the theist argument not plausible i speak against strong atheism i also often find that the evidence supporting a faith is very subjective just as say the evidence supporting love as truth is subjective i believe i answered that i apologize for the as you stated incorrect assumption on your theism but i saw nothing to indicate that you were an agnostic only that you were just another newbie christian on the net trying to get some cheap shots in

"from ray ingles subject re concerning god s morality was americans and evolution organization university of michigan engineering ann arbor lines distribution world nntp posting host syndicoot engin umich edu in article writes why do babies get diseases etc what god did create was life according to a protein code which is mutable and can evolve without delving into a deep discussion of creationism vs evolutionism here s the main problem the scenario you outline is reasonably consistent but all the evidence that i am familiar with not only does not support it but indicates something far different the earth by latest estimates is about billion years old and has had life for about billion of those years humans have only been around for at most about years but the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving and in fact disease ridden long before there were people yes there are fossils that show signs of disease mostly bone disorders of course but there are some heck not just fossil evidence but what we ve been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long long time if human sin was what brought about disease at least indirectly though necessarily then how could it exist before humans god created the original genetic code perfect and without flaw and without getting sidetracked into the theological ramifications of the original sin the main effect of the so called original sin for this discussion was to remove humanity from god s protection since by their choice a e cut themselves off from intimate fellowship with god in addition their sin caused them to come under the dominion of satan who then assumed dominion over the earth deletions since humanity was no longer under god s protection but under satan s dominion it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer diseases both bacterial viral and genetic although the forces of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this uh i know of many evolutionary biologists who know more about biology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with this there is no evidence that the human genetic code or any other started off in perfect condition it seems to adapt to its envionment in a collective sense i m really curious as to what you mean by the degeneration of the genetic code human dna being more complex tends to accumulate errors adversely affecting our well being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler dna of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in causing infection and disease it is a bad combination umm nah we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria and they to us only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size but the ranks keep changing for example bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease i m sure you ll agree but it still pops up from time to time even today and doesn t do as much damage part of that is because of better sanitation but even when people get the disease the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past this seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago and because the really nasty variants overgrazed forgive the poor terminology i m an engineer not a doctor and died off for lack of nearby hosts i could be wrong on this but from what i gather acne is only a few hundred years old and used to be nastier though no killer it seems to be getting less nasty w age hence we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial diseases disorders now wait a minute i have a question humans were created perfect right and you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease it seems unlikely that satan who s making the diseases would also gift humans with the means to fight them off simpler to make the diseases less lethal if he wants survivors as far as i can see our immune systems imperfect though they may presently be must have been built into us by god i want to be clear on this are you saying that god was planning ahead for the time when satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not at the time of design necessary that is god made our immune systems ahead of time knowing that adam and eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases this may be more of a mystical supernatural explanation than you are prepared to accept but god is not responsible for disease even if satan had nothing to do with the original inception of disease evolution by random chance would have produced them since humanity forsook god s protection here s another puzzle what exactly do you mean by perfect in the phrase created perfect and without flaw to my mind a perfect system would be incapable of degrading over time a perfect system that will without constant intervention become imperfect is not a perfect system at least imho or is it that god did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with elmer s glue that is the original genetic instructions were perfect but were written in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart if so why could god not have used better materials was god incapable of creating a system that could maintain itself of did it just choose not to deletions in summary newborns are innocent but god does not cause their suffering my main point as i said was that there really isn t any

something i say can t be all bad seriously i m not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes and i still disagree with your contention that nobody who doesn t use methods deemed scientific can possibly know what s true and what s not deleted material which i agree with back to lee lady these are not the rules according to many who post to sci med and sci psychology according to these posters if it s not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it s not science these posters are making the mistake that i have previously criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe a carefully rules such as support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study are too narrow to apply to all investigation i think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things to reuse the previous example we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously problematic okay so let s see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that a treatment is useful this is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support in this case it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing secondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i come to this dispute about what science is not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci psychology and occasionally in sci med about nlp neurolinguistic programming much of the work done to date by nlpers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research for years now i have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes courtesy of your local university library not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement but simply to look at the nlp methodology especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest and most especially to be aware of the questions nlp suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation over and over again the response i get in sci pychology is if this hasn t been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can t be of any interest to us to me the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme there ve got to be controlled studies position is an nlp technique called the fast phobia trauma cure simple phobias as opposed to agoraphobia may not be the world s most important psychological disorder but the nice thing about them is that it doesn t take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone is cured of one the nlp phobia cure is a simple visualization which requires less than minutes nlpers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory and hence is useful in treating post traumatic stress syndrome it is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists a subject only needs to be taken through the technique once or in the case of ptsd once for each traumatic incident the process doesn t need to be repeated and the subject doesn t need to practice it over again at home now to me it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure especially if as nlpers claim the success rate is extremely high take someone with a fear of heights as i used to have take them up to a balcony on the th floor and observe their response spend minutes to have them do the simple visualization send them back up to the balcony and see if things have changed check back with them in a few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting more long term follow up is certainly desirable but from a scientific point of view even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance in any case there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years to the best of my knowledge there is no known case where the cure has been reversed after holding for a few weeks my own cure incidentally was done with a slightly different nlp technique before i learned of the fast phobia trauma cure ten years later now i enjoy living on the th floor of my building and having a large balcony the folks over in sci psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since they re not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance the fast phobia trauma cure is over ten years old now and the clinical psychology establishment is still saying we don t have any way of knowing that it s effective these academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate as anyone could want of course but they say why should i prove your theory and the burden of proof is on the one making the claim one academic in sci psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn t been described in a scientific journal it s described in a number of books and i ve posted articles in sci psychology describing it in as much detail as i m capable of actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but it s apparently not acceptable because it s a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal to me this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it this is the kind of thing i have in mind when i talk about doctrinnaire attitudes about science now maybe i have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you russell if so i apologize in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects",312

"from fred rice subject re slavery was re why is sex only allowed in marriage organization monash university melb australia lines in selim guncer writes you might not like what bernard lewis writes about label him as a zionist or such to discredit him etc you misrepresent me selim the hard evidence for my statements about his lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book orientalism by edward said edward said by the way is a christian not a muslim i think he is pretty much objective in his treatment in race and slavery in the middle east since he clearly distinguishes between slavery under islam and the practice of slavery in other countries like the us prior to the civil war he also does not conceal that there are verses in the quran which promote the liberation of slaves what he doesn t and i don t think nobody can deduce from these verses is that slavery will eventually be abolished in islamic countries now you might rather conveniently blame the practice of slavery on muslims but the facts are out there i also fail to see the relevance of the claim of lewis being a zionist to what i wrote regarding bernard lewis him being a zionist gives him a political motive for his giving misrepresentations and half truths about islam read orientalism by edward said see the evidence for yourself in fact i may post some of it here if it isn t too long they were encyclopaedic information which anybody can access that slavery was abolished at certain dates some years after muhammed that this was the cause of tensions in the ottoman empire between the arab slave traders and the government etc we also have in the asu library volumes of british documents on slavery where reports and documents concerning slavery all around the world can be found which i checked some of the incidents lewis mentions so i don t think ones political stance has anything to do with documentary evidence i haven t read lewis s article so i can t comment directly upon it and have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far that his political motives make him a biased writer on islam his anti islamic polemics as i understand it are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half truths again read orientalism by edward said i am _not_ asking you to take what i say on trust in fact i am urging you not to do so but to get this book it is a well known book and check the evidence out for _yourself_ the issue i raised was that slaves were used for sexual purposes when it was claimed that islam prohibits extra marital sex i wrote that the prophet himself had concubines i wrote an incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not want his concubine to get pregnant etc which is contrary to the notion that sex is for procreation only in other words such claims are baseless in the quran and the hadith if slavery is _in reality_ as opposed to in the practice of some muslims opposed by islam then using slaves for sexual purposes is necessarily opposed too i seem to be unsuccesful in getting through to you islam is not advocating slavery slavery was an existing institution in the th century it advised on slaves being freed for good deeds etc which is nothing new many cultures saw this as a good thing what is the problem here but i can argue rightfully that slaves were discouraged about thinking about their statuses politically the quran rewards the good slave so obey your master and perhaps one day you ll be free but it is very understandable that i do not communicate with muslims since they assume the quran is from a god and i think it is a rule based system imposed on the society for preservation of the status quo slaves are a part of this system the subordination of women so that their function in society boils down to child making is a part of this system etc i understand your point of view selim i think rather it is _us_ who are not getting through to _you_ some of the points you repeat above i have already answered before regarding women i have made posting after posting on this subject showing that islam is not anti woman etc however have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them i just reposted a very good one under the title islam and women reposted from soc religion islam if this has already disappeared from your site then please email me telling me so and i will email you a copy of this excellent article imho your understanding of the issue of women in islam is sadly deficient regarding slaves _my_ posting on slavery the second one i made which is a repost of an article i wrote early last year is based completely on the qur an and contains numerous qur anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view our approaches are different you are arguing from a historical standpoint and i am arguing directly from the teachings of the qur an and hadiths now just because people say they are muslims and perform a particular action does that automatically mean that their action is part of islam even if it is opposed by the qur an and sunnah no of course not let me give you a concrete example which might help clarify this for you the qur an prohibits drinking now if a person says i am a muslim and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer does this now mean that islam teaches that people should drink beer of course not and only an idiot would think so do you see my point it is very natural to think that the author authors of the quran had no idea that the socio economic structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm shifts in years in the western cultures first with the end of the feudal era and the rise of commerce second with the industrial revolution well rules have changed and the status quo has driven muslim countries into misery trying to survive in a heathen world muslim countries have failed economically they were unable to accumulate any wealth directly due to the uncomprimising economic rules in the quran in fact the rise of islam can easily be modeled after the pyramid effect you do not produce any wealth at home but increase your wealth by conquering places you are judging islam here on capitalist terms capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth this assumption is in opposition to islamic teachings to say islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist this does not mean that islam does not support a free market for it does in general but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to islam as i understand it when this stopped you and i were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour no capital no industry very poor social services the education level in muslim countries are the lowest in the world the health statistics are miserable etc one can postulate numerous reasons for this your theory is that it is because islam is not secularist and capitalist etc etc selim i will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think as you obviously do that islam lack of education and power for a large part of history the islamic world was very powerful for a significant section of history the islamic world was the foremost in the sciences so to say that islam is for example anti education is completely absurd you try to blame this situation on islam history shows that your conclusion is false and that instead there must be other reasons for this situation you blame muslims for not following the quran but i blame muslims for following the quran well selim your viewpoint on women in islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of islam i really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the muslims are following the qur an or not your idea is baseless from historical facts it is a poor utopia the islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage yet somehow in your theory it is by following the qur an that muslims are backwards in education selim it is _your_ thesis that is anti historical for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory while my ideas are derived from social and economic history you have certainly not shown this you have merely stated it so far it seems to me that your view on islam being anti education is quite contrary to history that you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this my solution to all muslims is simple cut the crap i think selim you should consider taking your own advice get the facts straight here too and work hard to reverse the effects of years of ignorance selim you have such conviction of your viewpoint yet you demonstrate ignorance not only of islam but also of islamic history particularly with respect to muslims being leaders of science till about or so i think yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history selim if i remember right you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from islam i think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues and start _reading_ some of our postings about islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have fred rice",348

"from joseph h buehler subject re sspx schism organization none lines in article larry l overacker writes you ask where we are i would echo that question i m not trying to be contentious but assuming that the pope has universal jurisdiction and authority what authority do you rely upon for your decisions what prevents me from choosing any doctrine i like and saying that papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time this is especially true since councils of bishops have basically stood by the pope the ultimate question is the traditional theology of the church this is the only thing that it is possible to resist a pope for his departure from the traditional doctrine of the church if commands from any authority conflict with tradition the commands must be disobeyed my own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way god would never allow a hair splitting situation to develop it would be too complex for people to figure out i don t view the present situation in the church as anything extremely complicated run through a list of what has happened in the last years in the catholic church and any impartial observer will be aghast it appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and tradition and also over authority and discipline the problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the catholic faith in my opinion most catholics know about zilch about the catholic faith this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops it s basically the reformation part ii there is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the catholic church are currently being trampled upon by the catholic hierarchy i could go on listing shocking things for an hour probably take the situation in campos brazil for example i m reading a book on what happened there after vatican council ii the bishop antonio de castro mayer never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of vatican ii he kept the traditional mass the same old catechisms etc he made sure the people knew their faith the catholic theology of obedience what modernism was etc he innoculated the people against what was coming well one day the order came from rome for his retirement it came when the pope was sick bishop de castro mayer waited until the pope recovered then inquired whether this command was what the pope really wanted or something that some liberal had commanded in his absence the pope confirmed the decision so the good bishop retired the injustice that followed was completely incredible a new bishop was installed he proceeded to expel most of bishop de castro mayer s clergy from their churches because they refused to celebrate the new mass the new bishop would visit a parish and celebrate a new mass the people would promptly walk out of the church en masse the bishop was enraged by this he usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church the priests would just start building new churches the people were completely behind them the old parishes had the new mass as the bishop desired and virtually no parishioners the prime motivation for all this was completely illegal according to canon law no priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional mass because of legislation enacted by pope saint pius v nor is there any obligation to say the new mass during all this process the people of campos not just private individuals but including civil authorities were constantly sending petitions and letters to rome to do something about the new modernist bishop nothing was ever done no help ever arrived from rome eventually priests were kicked out and about people my question to the supporters of sspx is this is there any way that your positions with respect to church reforms could change and be conformed to those of the pope assuming that the pope s position does not change and that the leaders of sspx don t jointly make such choice if not this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority if i adopt the view that i m not wrong i can t be wrong and there s no way i ll change my mind you must change yours that i ve either left the catholic church or it has left me if the pope defines certain things ex cathedra that would be the end of the controversy that process is all very well understood in catholic theology and anyone who doesn t go along with it is an instant non catholic the problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the catholic world if they knew the faith and what our bishops are doing they would be shocked we sould argue from now until the second coming about what the real traditional teaching of the church is if this were a simple matter east and west would not have been separated for over years this isn t the case in the catholic church there is a massive body of traditional teaching the popes of the last years are especially relevant there is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is i thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term i may be wrong here i m not roman catholic that s heresy more or less although they have done a great job since the reformation the last years have seen so many errors spread that it s pitiful infallibility rests in the pope and in the church as a whole in the short term a pope or large sections of the church can go astray in fact that s what usually happens during a major heresy large sections of the church go astray the pope historically has been much more reliable everything will always come back in the long run what would be the effect of a pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the sspx situation would it be honored if not how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility again i m not trying to be contentions i m trying to understand since i m orthodox i ve got no real vested interest in the outcome one way or the other yes it would be honored infallibility is infallibility but what is he going to define that the new mass is a better expression of the catholic faith than the old that sex education in the catholic schools is wonderful that all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the popes prior to vatican ii it does if the command was legitimate sspx does not view the pope s commands as legitimate why this is a very slippery slope not really start studying the major catholic theologians of the last years everything is very well spelled out the west excels at critical thought remember that s what catholic theologians have been busy at for centuries",358

"from jason smith subject re atheist s views on christianity was re accepting jeesus in your heart organization atlas telecom inc lines in article petri pihko writes jason smith wrote the discussion begins why does the universe exist at all one of the laws of nature specifying cause and effect seems to dictate at least to this layman s mind there must be a causal event no reasonable alternative exists i would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime causes precede their effects and i must concede here cause before effect implies time time is part of spacetime hense the argument would be valid i could return and say that this does not infer the cause and effect relationship being unique to this spacetime but i won t because the point is moot doesn t address why which petri pikho addresses below i also concede that i was doubly remiss as i asserted no reasonable alternative exists an entirely subjective statement on my part and one that could be invalidated given time and further discovery by the scientist i also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily specify that this is how it happened but proposes a likely description of the phenomena in question am i mistaken with this understanding but if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the universe our spacetime emerge from nothing science has some good candidates for an answer all of which require something we christians readily admit to faith the fact that there are several candidates belies that none are conclusive with out conclusive evidence we are left with faith it could even be argued that one of these hypotheses may one day be proven as best as a non repeatable event can be proven but i ask what holds someone today to the belief that any or all of them are correct except by faith a couple of paragraphs deleted summary we ask why does the universe exist i think this question should actually be split into two parts namely why is there existence why anything exists and how did the universe emerge from nothing it is clear science has nothing to say about the first question however is it a meaningful question after all i would say it isn t consider the following apparently it is for many persons hence we have religions the question why anything exists can be countered by demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in nothingness or in non existence actually both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning things that exist do and things that don t exist don t exist tautology at its best carefully examine the original question and then the counter question the first asks why while the second is a request for definition it doesn t address why something does or does not exist but asks to define the lack of existence the second question is unanswerable indeed for how do we identify something as nothing aren t they mutually exclusive terms how do we identify a state of non existence again this is nearing the limits of this simple layman s ability to comprehend and i would appreciate an explanation i might add the worldview of things that exist do and things that don t don t is as grounded in the realm of the non falsifiable as does the theist s belief in god it is based on the assumption that there is not a reason for being something as ultimately un supportable as the position of there being a reason its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there is a reason we come to this either i am therefore i am or i am for a reason if the former is a satisfactory answer then you are done for you are satisfied and need not a doctor if the latter your search is just beginning i seriously doubt god could have an answer to this question time will tell some christians i have talked to have said that actually god is himself the existence however i see several problems with this answer first it inevitably leads to the conclusion that god is actually _all_ existence good and evil devils and angels us and them this is pantheism not christianity agreed it would lead me to question their definition of christianity as well another answer is that god is the _source_ of all existence this sounds much better but i am tempted to ask does god himself exist then if god is the source of his own existence it can only mean that he has in terms of human time always existed but this is not the same as the source of all existence this does not preclude his existence it only seeks to identify his qualities implying he exists to have qualities btw the best answer i have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions being an atheist myself i do not accept such answers since i do not have any other methods like the theist we come to a statement of faith for this position assumes that the evidence at hand is conclusive note i am not arguing against scientific endeavor for science is useful for understanding the universe in which we exist but i differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective i seek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the creator i also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer why it appears that m pihko agrees as we shall see but because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question asserting that why is an invalid question does not provide an answer as far as i can tell the very laws of nature demand a why that isn t true of something outside of nature i e super natural this is not true science is a collection of models telling us how not why something happens i can not see any good reason why the why questions would be bound only to natural things assuming that the supernatural domain exists if supernatural beings exist it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist my apologies i was using why as why did this come to be why did pre existence become existence why did pre spacetime become spacetime but we come to the admission that science fails to answer why because it can t be answered in the realm of modern science does that make the question invalid i don t believe any technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite having all of the parts available just my opinion this opinion is also called vitalism namely that living systems are somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems do christians in general adopt this position what would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life say small bacteria in a lab i suppose we would do the same thing as when galileo or capernicus was vindicated before someone starts jumping up and down screaming inquisition note i said vindicated i certainly hope we ve gotten beyond the shooting the messenger stage m pihko does present a good point though we may need to ask what do i as an individual christian base my faith on will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our sacred cows or will we seek to understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what god said and continues to say in his word why do i ask why apologies to budweiser and company jason jason d smith

"from stephen mcintyre subject theists and objectivity organization university of nebraska at omaha lines can a theist be truly objective can he be impartial when questioning the truth of his scriptures or will he assume the superstition of his parents when questioning i ve often found it to be the case that the theist will stick to some kind of superstition when wondering about god and his scriptures i ve seen it in the christian the jew the muslim and the other theists alike all assume that their mothers and fathers were right in the aspect that a god exists and with that belief search for their god occasionally the theist may switch religions or aspects of the same religion but overall the majority keep to the belief that some creator was behind the universe s existence i ve known muslims who were once christians and vice versa i ve known christians who were once jewish and vice versa and i ve even known christians who become hindu yet throughout their transition from one faith to another they ve kept this belief in some form of higher being why it usually all has to do with how the child is brought up from the time he is born the theist is brought up with the notion of the truth of some kind of scripture the bible the torah the qur an etc he is told of this wondrous god who wrote or inspired the scripture of the prophets talked about in the scripture of the miracles performed etc he is also told that to question this as children are apt to do is a sin a crime against god and to lose belief in the scrip ture s truth is to damn one s soul to hell thus by the time he is able to read the scripture for himself the belief in its truth is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a matter of course but it doesn t stop there once the child is able to read for himself there is an endeavor to inculcate the child the right readings of scripture to concentrate more on the pleasant readings to gloss over the worse ones and to explain away the unexplainable with mystery circular arguments self evdent facts and truths unreasoning belief and fear of hell is the meat of religion the child must eat of every day to doubt of course means wrath of some sort and the child must learn to put away his brain when the matter concerns god all of this has some considerable effect on the child so that when he becomes an adult the superstitions he s been taught are nearly impossible to remove all of this leads me to ask whether the theist can truly be objective when questioning god hell heaven the angels souls and all of the rest can he for a moment put aside this notion that god does exist and look at everything from a unbiased point of view obviously most theists can somewhat especially when presented with mythical gods homeric roman egyptian etc but can they put aside the assumption of god s existence and question it impartially stephen _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ atheist _ _ _ _ _ _ _ libertarian _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ pro individuality _ _ _ _ _ pro responsibility _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ jr and all that jazz this is ad hominem attack of the most basic kind none of their statements matter they believe the way they do because they were brought up that way of course there are atheists who have become theists and theists who have become atheists rather more of the latter which is not surprising given the statistics it s hard to see how one could possibly answer a posting of this sort since any answer could immediately be assumed to be just part of the brainwashing that is how can anyone possibly show that they aren t biased clh",398

thousand dollars american i expect for idl and the other should be free those are the general purpose packages i ve heard of besides what terramar has sips _was_ written for aviris imagery i m not sure how general purpose it is you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask i have another piece of software pcw that does pc and walsh transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image modification you can compute an image using selected components i ve used it on megabyte aviris images without problems but for the best speed you need an external dsp

in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its programming language is very strong and easy very pascal like it handles the number crunching very well also personally i like doing the number crunching with idl on the vax or mathematica igor or even excel on the mac if it s not too hairy then bringing it over to nih image for the imaging part i have yet to encounter any situation which that combination couldn t handle and the speed and ease of use compared to iraf was incredible by the way it s mostly astronomical image processing which i ve been doing this means image enhancement

software grass geographic resource analysis support system of the us army construction engineering research lab cerl it is a popular geographic and remote sensing image processing package many may think of grass as a geographic information system rather than an image processing package although it is reported to have significant image processing capabilities feature descriptions i use grass because it s public domain and can be obtained through the internet for free grass runs in unix and is written in c the source code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the office of grass integration you then compile the source code for your machine using scripts provided with grass i would recommend grass for someone who already has a workstation and is on a limited budget grass is not very user friendly compared to macintosh software a first review of overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose image enhancement routines fft kelly maurice at vexcel corp in boulder co is a primary user of grass this gentleman has used the grass software and developed multi spectral bands volumetric rendering full color on suns and stardents it was a really effective interface vexcel corp currently has a contract to map part of venus and convert the magellan radar data into contour maps you can call them at or email care of host configuration requirements if you are willing to run a ux you could install grass on a macintosh which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for satellite data grass is public domain and can run on a high end pc under unix it is raster based has some image processing capability and can display vector data but analysis must be done in the raster environment i have used grass v on a sun workstation and found it easy to use it is best of course for data that are well represented in raster grid cell form availability cerl s office of grass integration ogi maintains an ftp server moon cecer army mil mail regarding this site should be addressed to this location will be the new canonical source for grass software as well as

images and there is all kinds of other software available for gis applications host configuration requirements it runs on intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun though there were rumors there are always rumors that the software would be ported to pc and possibly a sun environment pci a company called pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada makes an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i forget the software is available in versions for ms dos unix workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly other platforms by now i use the vms version the pci software consists of several classes groups packages of utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci database disk file the tape i o package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote sensing industry tape formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file this is the only package i use or know much about other packages can display data from the pci database to one or another of several pci supported third party color displays output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer e g an epson type dot matrix graphics printer you might be more spe cifically interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and fourier analysis equalization user specified operations e g multiply channel by add channel and store as channel and god only knows what all else there s a lot i don t have and don t use these so can t say much about them you only buy the packages your particular application interest calls for each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default directory some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations the standard pci environment contains a scripting language very similar to ibm pc basic but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility executions in vms i can also invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure there s also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with read from write to the pci data structures database file parameter file the pci software is designed specifically for remote sensing images but requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r s images you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well for instance the tape i o package offers a utility for reading headerless multi band what adobe photoshop on the macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic arts industry s ctt format would probably i haven t tried handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what you re doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over it s worth noting that the pci database file is designed to contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table land use and all manner of other information i observe that a remote sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this can go into the pci database i _believe_ that on workstations the built in display is used on vax systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific third party display systems the name gould deanza seems to come to mind one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vct q q bus bit directcolor display subsystem pci software could be overkill in your case it seems designed for the very high end applications users i e those for whom a mac pc largely doesn t suffice although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time it s probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which does a lot of its land resource management via remote sensing i believe the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these areas spam spectral analysis manager back in jpl developed something called spam spectral analysis manager which got a fair amount of use at the time that was designed for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery byte data pixels across by lines by bands a modified version has since been developed for aviris airborne visual and infrared imaging spectrometer which uses much larger images spam does none of these things rectification classification pc and ihs transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement stretching spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering the original spam uses x or sunview to display the aviris version may require vicar an executive based on tae and may also require a frame buffer i can refer you to people if you re interested pcw requires x for

"subject omnipotence was re speculations from lines in article robert knowles writes date fri apr from nanci ann miller can god uncreate itself no for if he did he would violate his own nature which he can not do it is god s nature to exist he is after all the i am which is a statement of his inherent existence he is existence itself existence can not not exist then as mentioned above he must not be very omnipotent what do you mean by omnipotent here do you mean by omnipotent that god should be able to do anything everything this creates a self contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless to be descriptive omnipotence must mean being all powerful and not being able to do anything everything let me illustrate by analogy suppose the united states were the only nuclear power on earth suppose further that the us military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations the us has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the us see fit the us would be militarily omnipotent but suppose further that the us holds to a doctrine philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation such as the current civil war in the former yugoslavian states technically in this scenario the us would have the power to unilaterally go into yugoslavia and straighten out the mess but effectively the us could not intervene without violating its own policy of non interference if the policy of non interference were held to strongly enough then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated effectively the us would be limited in what it could actually do although it had the power to do whatever it wanted the us would simply never want to interfere for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non interference policy god is effectively limited in the same sense he is all powerful but he can not use his power in a way that would violate the essence of what he himself is i hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence regards jim b",421

tucson hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april articles low levels of airborne particles linked to serious asthma attacks american lung association a new study published by the american lung association has shown that surprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with asthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment the seattle based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution the actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed unsafe under federal air quality laws people with asthma have inflamed airways and airborne particles tend to exacerbate that inflammation said joel schwartz ph d of the environmental protection agency who was the lead author of the study when people are on the threshold of having a serious asthma attack particles can push them over the edge the seattle study correlated months of asthma emergency room visits with daily levels of pm or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of microns or less these finer particles are considered hazardous because they are small enough penetrate into the lung cities are considered out of compliance with clean air laws if the hour average concentration of pm exceeds micrograms per cubic millimeter of air in seattle however a link between fine particles and asthma was found at levels as low as micrograms the authors concluded that for every microgram increase in the four day average of pm the odds of someone with asthma needing emergency treatment increased by percent the findings were published in the april american review of respiratory disease an official journal of the american thoracic society the lung association s medical section the study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat a study by dr schwartz and douglas dockery ph d of harvard found that particles may be causing roughly premature deaths each year in the united states other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms and bronchitis in children government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone says dr schwartz but more and more research is showing that particles are bad actors as well one problem in setting standards for particulate air pollution is that pmio is difficult to study unlike other regulated pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide particulate matter is a complex and varying mixture of substances including carbon hydrocarbons dust and hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april acid aerosols researchers can t put people in exposure chambers to study the effects of particulate air pollution says dr schwartz we have no way of duplicating the typical urban mix of particles consequently most of what is known about particulates has been learned through population based research like the seattle study given that the epa s current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur dioxide standards the agency is unlikely to reexamine the pm standard any time soon until changes are made there appears to be little people with asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles in some areas you can get reports on air quality but the reports only cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard and that s rarely particulate matter says dr schwartz however pm doesn t have to be near its violation range to be unhealthy hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april

centers program is comprised of nci designated cancer centers actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer incidence morbidity and mortality within the program there are four types of cancer centers basic science cancer centers which engage primarily in basic cancer research clinical cancer centers which focus on clinical research comprehensive cancer centers which emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research patient care and community outreach and consortium cancer centers which specialize in cancer prevention and control research although some cancer centers existed in the late s and the s it was the national cancer act of that authorized the establishment of new cancer centers as well as continuing support for existing ones the passage of the act also dramatically transformed the centers structure and broadened the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic clinical and cancer control research over the next two decades the centers program grew progressively in there were comprehensive cancer centers in the nation today there are of these institutions all of which meet specific nci criteria for comprehensive status to attain recognition from the nci as a comprehensive cancer center an institution must pass rigorous peer review under guidelines newly established in the eight criteria for comprehensiveness include the requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields such as biology and molecular genetics a strong program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical practice moreover five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly beyond that required for attaining a cancer center support grant also referred to as a p or core grant the mechanism of choice for supporting the infrastructure of a cancer center s operations these criteria encompass strong participation in nci designated high priority clinical trials significant levels of cancer prevention and control research and important outreach and educational activities all of which are funded by a variety of sources the other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit important new findings or address timely research questions hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april of the nci designated cancer centers are of the basic science type these centers engage almost entirely in basic research although some centers engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications from new discoveries in the laboratory clinical cancer centers in contrast focus on both basic research and clinical research within the same institutional framework and frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their overall research programs there are such centers today finally consortium cancer centers of which there is one are uniquely structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and control research these centers interface with state and local public health departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions responsible for implementing population wide public health programs consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials together the nci designated cancer centers continue to work toward creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research and through interdisciplinary efforts to effectively move this research from the laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice comprehensive

of others at the same time the report was inaccurate and i expect there to be some announcement in the next hours about that particular aids research project said shalala administration sources

"from petri pihko subject re concerning god s morality long organization university of oulu finland x newsreader tin version pl lines this kind of argument cries for a comment wrote in article scott compton writes jim you originally wrote god did not create disease nor is he responsible for the maladies of newborns what god did create was life according to a protein code which is mutable and can evolve without delving into a deep discussion of creationism vs evolutionism god created the original genetic code perfect and without flaw do you have any evidence for this if the code was once perfect and has degraded ever since we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement shouldn t we perhaps the biggest imperfection of the code is that it is full of non coding regions introns which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions exons an impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains is the number of introns decreasing or increasing it appears that intron loss can occur and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon intron structure in their genes on the other hand the possibility that introns have been inserted later presents several logical difficulties introns are removed by a splicing mechanism this would have to be present but unused if introns are inserted moreover intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting random insertion would not be tolerated since sequences for intron removal self splicing of mrna are conserved besides transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace long terminal repeats and target site duplications and these are not found in or near intron sequences i seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting theological arguments like this try watson s molecular biology of the gene or darnell lodish baltimore s molecular biology of the cell for starters remember the question was posed in a theological context why does god cause disease in newborns and my answer is likewise from a theological perspective my own it is no less valid than a purely scientific perspective just different scientific perspective is supported by the evidence whereas theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion i think you misread my meaning i said god made the genetic code perfect but that doesn t mean it s perfect now it has certainly evolved since for the worse would you please cite a few references that support your assertion your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective unless you support it by some evidence in fact it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we ve thought for instance sex might have evolved as defence against parasites this view is supported by computer simulations of evolution eg tierra perhaps i thought it was higher energy rays like x rays gamma rays and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage in fact it is thermal energy that does most of the damage although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action actually neither of us knows what the atmosphere was like at the time when god created life according to my recollection most biologists do not claim that life began billion years ago after all that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth was created it would still be too primitive to support life i seem to remember a figure more like to billion years ago for the origination of life on earth anyone with a better estimate i d replace created with formed since there is no need to invoke any creator if the earth can be formed without one most recent estimates of the age of the earth range between billion years and earliest signs of life not true fossils but organic stromatolite like layers date back to billion years this would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve i m sorry i can t give any references this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry i attended here dominion it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer diseases both bacterial viral and genetic although the forces of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this again do you _want_ this be true or do you have any evidence for this supposed degeneration i can understand scott s reaction excuse me but this is so far fetched that i know you must be jesting do you know what pathogens are do you know what point mutations are do you know that everything can come about spontaneously in response to your last statement no and neither do you you may very well believe that and accept it as fact but you can not know that i hope you don t forget this we have _evidence_ that suggests everything can come about spontaneously do you have evidence against this conclusion in science one does not have to _believe_ in anything it is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve but the right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so and not to present one s own conclusions prior to this theology does not use this method therefore i seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions human dna being more complex tends to accumulate errors adversely affecting our well being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler dna of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in causing infection and disease it is a bad combination hence we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial diseases disorders you are supposing a purpose not a valid move bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease they are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution only replication saves replicators from degradiation we are just an efficient method for our dna to survive and replicate the less efficient methods didn t make it to the present and for the last time please present some evidence for your claim that human dna is degrading through evolutionary processes some people have claimed that the opposite is true we have suppressed our selection and thus are bound to degrade i haven t seen much evidence for either claim but then i ask so where is this relevant to my discussion in answering john s question of why why are there genetic diseases and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require babies to develop antibodies is it god s fault the original question i say no it is not of course nothing evil is god s fault but your explanation does not work it fails miserably you may be right but the fact is that you don t know that satan is not responsible and neither do i suppose that a powerful evil being like satan exists would it be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills that affect mankind i don t think so he could have done a much better job pun intended the problem is it seems no satan is necessary to explain any diseases they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution did i say that where seems to me like another bad inference actually what you ve done is to oversimplify what i said to the point that your summary of my words takes on a new context i never said that people are meant presumably by god to be punished by getting diseases why i did say is that free moral choices have attendent consequences if mankind chooses to reject god as people have done since the beginning then they should not expect god to protect them from adverse events in an entropic universe i am not expecting this if god exists i expect him to leave us alone i would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free this is an interesting philosophical question and the answer is not as clear cut as it seems to be what consequences would you expect from rejecting allah oh i admit it s not perfect yet but i m working on it a good library or a bookstore is a good starting point what does this have to do with the price of tea in china or the question to which i provided an answer biology and genetics are fine subjects and important scientific endeavors but they explain how god created and set up life processes they don t explain the why behind creation life or its subsequent evolution why is there a why behind and your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence this is why we recommend these books is there any need to invoke any why behind a prime mover evidence for this if the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention as recent cosmological theories hawking et al suggest why do people still insist on this thanks scotty for your fine and sagely advice but i am not highly motivated to learn all the nitty gritty details of biology and genetics although i m sure i d find it a fascinating subject for i realize that the details do not change the big picture that god created life in the beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its environment i m sorry but they do there is no evidence for your big picture and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation it can come into existence without a supreme being try reading p w atkins creation revisited freeman petri ___ petri pihko mathematics is the truth ___ pihatie c

"from subject candida yeast bloom fact or fiction lines nntp posting host vms ocom okstate edu organization osu college of osteopathic medicine i can not believe the way this thread on candida yeast has progressed steve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci med nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it s environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics these are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief like elaine in sci med nutrition and then when they find one that solves their problem the rest start yelling quack could it just be professional jealousy i couldn t help elaine or jon but somebody else did could they know more than me no way they must be a quack i ve been teaching a human nutrition course for medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are those that were raised on farms and saw first hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school switched to the vegan diet typically this is about of my class of students those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class that s okay because i know that some of what i m teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the u s it s really too bad that most u s medical schools don t cover nutrition because if they did candida would not be viewed as a non disease by so many in the medical profession in animal husbandry an animal is reinnoculated with good bacteria after antibiotics are stopped medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach no such reinnoculation with good bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier steve got real upset with elaine s doctor because he was using anti fungals and vitamin a for her gi problems if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body he would not or at least should not be calling elaine s doctor a quack here is a brief primer on yeast yeast infections as they are commonly called are not truely caused by yeasts the most common organism responsible for this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually a yeast like fungus an infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis candidiasis is a very rare occurance because like an e coli infection it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level diabetes or an oral course of antibiotics has been used in diabetics their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose candida unlike bacteria is very limited in it s food fuel selection without glucose it can not grow it just barely survives if it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina in diabetics skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers the bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn t certain when the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to treat it if it s internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the gi tract mouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets about of all american s die with less vitamin a than they were born with u s autopsy studies while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathology blindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom while diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the anti fungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then anti fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr steve dyer says but even in patients being given the anti fungals the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus gi tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed lack of a good bacterial flora in the body and or poor mucus membrane barrier lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth from it s name it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment in the vagina l acidophilius is the predominate bacteria unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics in the gi system the ano rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan has told me throiugh e mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives candida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on a constant basis i would want it fixed yes it s nice to know that i don t have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me better steve dyer calls him a quack candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment the vagina becomes alkaline during a woman s period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract i would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this my wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti fungal creams this was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem recurring vaginal yeast infections this m d did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and l acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile after three treatments sex returned to our marraige i have often wondered what an m d with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non existent syndrome the nonpathogenic bacteria l acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women if taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes but before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the b complex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b and folate these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non existent disorder candida blooms after antibiotic therapy some of the above material was obtained from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gi system is involved if candida can not get glucose it s not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut if steve and some of the other nay sayers want to jump all over this post fine i jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor s use of vitamin a and anti fungals for a candida bloom in her gut people seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart s content if you saved your venom for me steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help

such as path to specify your correct e mail address to reply to what is jpeg jpeg pronounced jay peg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard jpeg is designed for compressing either full color or gray scale digital images of natural real world scenes it does not work so well on non realistic images such as cartoons or line drawings jpeg does not handle black and white bit per pixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn t quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details aren t perceived as well as small details of light and dark thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans if you plan to machine analyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make extremely small files if you don t mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc conversely if you aren t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression why use jpeg there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store bit per pixel color data instead of bit per pixel data making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images being able to compress a mbyte full color file down to kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one more details below if your viewing software doesn t support jpeg directly you ll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images even with a jpeg capable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance thus using jpeg is essentially a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply it s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file i ll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information bits pixel million colors instead of or less or fewer colors if you have only bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of years though bit gif will look as obsolete as black and white macpaint format does today furthermore for reasons detailed in section jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing full color or gray scale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material jpeg is superior even if you don t have bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do see section for details gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg can t squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular single color borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pure black pixels adjacent to a row of pure white pixels for example sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that s only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text don t jpeg it computer drawn images ray traced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawings and such plain black and white two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray scale images it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray scale images of up to levels while jpeg is not if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a little image quality if you do section which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a full color original if you start from a gif you ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway this is a decision you ll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section for hints be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well how well does jpeg compress images pretty darn well here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a x full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section b file size in bytes comments ship ppm original file in ppm format no compression bits or bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead ship ppm z ppm file passed through unix compress compress doesn t accomplish a lot you ll note other text oriented compressors give similar results ship gif converted to gif with ppmquant fs ppmtogif most of the savings is the result of losing color info gif saves bits pixel not see sec ship jpg cjpeg q highest useful quality setting this is indistinguishable from the bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs ship jpg cjpeg q default setting you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on screen at once ship jpg cjpeg q this has slight defects if you know what to look for you could tell it s been jpeged without seeing the original still as good image quality as many recent postings in usenet pictures groups ship jpg cjpeg q jpeg s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some still i ve seen plenty of usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this ship jpgo cjpeg q optimize optimize cuts table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes note that this file is tiny the compression ratio from the original is in this case jpeg can make a file that s a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a full color display this seems to be a typical ratio for real world scenes what are good quality settings for jpeg most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings quality does not mean keep of the information as some have claimed the quality scale is purely arbitrary it s not a percentage of anything the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb the default quality setting q is very often the best choice this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image try q first if you see defects then go up except for experimental purposes never go above q saying q will produce a file two or three times as large as q but of hardly any better quality if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q is about right for compressing bit images but q to is usually better for converting gifs see section for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of to is about right q or so may be amusing as op art note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section b and to many programs based on it other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some programs don t even provide a numeric scale just high medium low style choices where can i get jpeg software most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you don t know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you don t have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article that article appears regularly in news answers or you can get it by sending e mail to with send usenet news answers finding sources in the body the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful it s usenet news answers ftp list faq in the news answers archive note this list changes constantly if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the news answers archive a if you are looking for canned software viewers etc the first part of this list is system specific programs that only run on one kind of system if you don t see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too x windows john bradley s free xv version and up is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and other image formats it s available for ftp from export lcs mit edu or ftp cis upenn edu the file is called xv tar z where is the version number currently it is located in the contrib directory on export or the pub xv directory at upenn xv reduces all images to bits internally which means it s not a real good choice if you have a bit display you ll still get only bit color also you shouldn t use xv to convert full color images to jpeg because they ll get color quantized first but xv is a fine tool for converting gif and other bit images to jpeg caution there is a glitch in versions and earlier be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x windows is john cristy s free imagemagick package also available from export lcs mit edu file contrib imagemagick tar z this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks the imagemagick viewer handles bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software both of the above are large complex packages if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release xloadimage is free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xloadimage tar z xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v decoder while xloadimage is using a hacked over v the next xloadimage release will fix this xli is also free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xli tar z both programs are said to do the right thing with bit displays ms dos this covers plain dos for windows or os programs see the next headings one good choice is eric praetzel s free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version a is available by ftp from sunee uwaterloo ca file pub jpeg viewers dvpega zip this is a good basic viewer that works on either or machines the user interface is not flashy but it s functional another freeware jpeg gif tga viewer is mohammad rezaei s hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics hv zip hiview requires a or better cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager qemm and max work windows and os do not hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panning scrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but there s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully a shareware alternative is colorview for dos this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives its user interface is also much spiffier looking although personally i find it harder to use more keystrokes inconsistent behavior it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics dcview zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you don t have one look in vesadrv zip or vesa tsr zip from the same directory many recent pcs have a built in vesa driver so don t try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i don t know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel archives at that time the well known gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision a however cshow s jpeg implementation isn t very good it s slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hi color displays too bad it d have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow shareware available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos gif cshwa zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine if you can t get any of them to work you ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer if you have hi color hardware don t use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targa capable viewer instead vpic is reputed to do the right thing with hi color displays the independent jpeg group s free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics jpeg zip or jpeg zip if you have a and extended memory these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats handmade software offers free jpeggif conversion tools gifjpg jpggif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you can t get bit color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi s proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenet standard jfif format since hsi format files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability version of these tools is free prior versions were shareware get it from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics gifjpg zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on non pc platforms handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics alch zip note about simtel the internet s key archive site for pc related programs is simtel full name wsmr simtel army mil simtel runs a non unix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdos graphics at simtel that really means pd if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead a popular usa mirror site is oak oakland edu which keeps simtel files in eg pub msdos graphics if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel by e mail see informational postings in comp archives msdos announce to find out how if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel mirror is microsoft windows there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast version is available from ftp rahul net file pub bryanw pc jpeg wecj zip requires windows and or more colors mode this is a no frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but it s so fast you ll use it anyway at least for previewing jview is freeware fairly fast has good on line help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it can t create new jpeg files and it doesn t view gifs jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but it s an excellent basic viewer the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop jview zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchive wustl edu winjpeg shareware displays jpeg gif targa tiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including color balance adjustment and slideshow the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note above file msdos windows winjp zip this is a slow compatible version if you register you ll get the only version which is roughly faster colorview is another shareware entry this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg if you want to try it anyway the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop cview zip i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos dvpeg see dos heading also works under windows but only in full screen mode not in a window os the following files are available from hobbes nmsu edu note check pub uploads for more recent

jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a or better cpu and you need to be running system or later if you re running system you must also install the bit quickdraw extension this is built in on system you can get quicktime by ftp from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime quicktime hqx as of this file contains quicktime which is better than qt in several ways with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt mac users should keep in mind that quicktime s jpeg format pict jpeg is not the same as the usenet standard jfif jpeg format see section for details if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pict jpeg format or gif format it also can convert between the two jpeg formats the current version is a big improvement over prior versions get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg view hqx requires system and quicktime on bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact it s the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over x pixels on a typical mb mac given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers you can zoom in on any desired portion though some people like this behavior some don t overall jpegview s user interface is very well thought out gifconverter a shareware image viewer converter supports jfif and pict jpeg as well as gif and several other image formats the latest version is get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac art gif gif converter hqx requires system or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg gif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime but it s faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg

and gif format and can convert between these formats you can get pictpixie from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime qt stuff pictpixie hqx requires quicktime pictpixie was intended as a developer s tool and it s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net if you have this you should trash it as it s even buggier also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net storm technology s picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer converter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems it does need bit quickdraw so really old machines can t use it you can get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app picture decompress hqx you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it if your machine is too old to run bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for single program jpeg viewing if you don t want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a

quantization most people don t have full color bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores or fewer bits per pixel so it can display or fewer distinct colors at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors this process is called color quantization this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term we re stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization is a lossy process it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings since jpeg is a full color format converting a color jpeg image for display on bit or less hardware requires color quantization this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a or less color gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpeg s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect it s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences i occasionally see posted images described as color jpeg this tells me that the poster a hasn t read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale just like photographs but number of colors just isn t a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to or fewer colors a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesn t allow more than palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don t have to this is also the disadvantage of gif you re stuck with the sender s quantization if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image furthermore if the sender didn t use a high quality color quantization algorithm you re out of luck for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don t match the sender s display hardware jpeg s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user s display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have with a gif you re stuck forevermore with what was sent it s also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines if you view a color gif on a color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often it s also due to sloppiness jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones finally an ever growing number of people have better than bit display hardware already bit hi color pc displays true bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc for these people gif is already obsolete as it can not represent an image to the full capabilities of their display jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine independent fashion how does jpeg work the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article s long enough already so i m not going to say more than that here for technical information see the comp compression faq this is available from the news answers archive at rtfm mit edu in files pub usenet news answers compression faq part if you need help in using the news answers archive see the top of this article what about lossless jpeg there s a great deal of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i e one that guarantees the final output is bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial saying q to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step with the v free jpeg code you can also say sample x to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations can not cope with the resulting file even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value it s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image at this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit for bit accuracy if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents why all the argument about file formats strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations since we can t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs aren t compatible with anybody else s the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work that s been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems they have defined two jpeg based file formats jfif jpeg file interchange format a low end format that transports pixels and not much else tiff jpeg aka tiff an extension of the aldus tiff format tiff is a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides tiff is a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff it s not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg related products it s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details even when tiff jpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in is apple s quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped inside the mac specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section a if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section for details another particular case is handmade software s programs gifjpg jpggif and image alchemy these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings use the j switch to get jfif output this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won t read it s likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file a jfif standard file will start with the characters hex ff d ff e followed by two variable bytes often hex followed by jfif if you see ff d at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file this is probably decodable as is by jfif software it s worth a try anyway hsi files start with hsi you re out of luck unless you have hsi software portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they won t decompress properly with non hsi programs a macintosh pict file if jpeg compressed will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif strip off everything before the ff d and you should be able to read it anything else it s a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you are lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d try stripping off everything before that in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is begin line m_ c_x whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with begin line m i if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non jfif files what about arithmetic coding the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file or percent smaller than huffman coding all the file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm at t and mitsubishi thus you can not legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isn t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tuned for further details does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss i e you get an identical jpeg file even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software it s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation output it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation if you re wondering why it s because the pixel block boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of pixels you might be safe but that s a mighty limited capability the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you don t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full color data the gif was made from it s far better to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section in particular cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don t convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif so check the sizes too experience to date suggests that large high visual quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation don t waste your time converting any gif much under kbytes also don t expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full color originals to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg files would be i e shoot for or rd the size of the gif file not th as suggested in earlier comparisons many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color border around a gif image while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you are on an x windows system xv s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this cjpeg s default q setting of is appropriate for full color input but for gif inputs q settings of to often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like high spatial frequency color noise and jpeg can t compress noise very well the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better looking output image than you d get without smoothing with the v free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in try smooth or so when converting gifs values of to seem to work well for high quality gifs heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors if you can see regular fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you don t want if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg s built in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality smooth is probably a good starting point for converting gifs but if you really care about the image you ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the independent jpeg group at tom lane organizer independent jpeg group internet

"from dr nancy s sweetie subject re certainty and arrogance organization rowan college of new jersey lines in an earlier article i explained that what many people find arrogant about christians is that some christians profess absolute certianty about their beliefs and doctrines that is many christians insist that they can not have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs which amounts to saying that they are infallible impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant most of us will probably agree in short the problem is that no matter how good your sources are if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning then those doctrines are suspect so long as your own brain is involved there is a possibility for error i summarised the problem by writing there is no way out of the loop someone called rexlex has claimed that there is a way out of the loop but he did not bother to explain what it was preferring instead to paraphrase sartre ramble about wittgenstein and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism as i have explained to him before you can not reject an argument as false because you dislike where it leads the facts do not change just because you dislike them rexlex wrote i disagree with dr nancy s sweetie s conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair however as any first year philosophy student can explain what rexlex has written does not constitute a refutation all he has said is that he does not like what i wrote he has done nothing at all to dispute it there were two sentences in rexlex s post that seemed relevant to the point at hand there is such a thing as true truth and it is real it can be experienced and it is verifiable i do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience i have for example direct experience of adding numbers i don t claim to be infallible at it in fact i remember doing sums incorrectly but i do claim that i have direct experience of reasoning about numbers however once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about them we are on much shakier ground that was the point of the earlier article human brains are infested with sin and they can only be trusted in very limited circumstances it is only because of god s own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing but how far does that get you once god s revelation stops and your own reasoning begins possibility for error appears for example let s suppose that our modern bible translations include a perfect rendering of jesus words at the last supper and that jesus said exactly this is my body we ll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely true what can we be certain of not much at the moment he stops speaking and people start interpreting the possibility of error appears did he mean that literally or not we do not have any record that he elaborated on the words was he thinking of tran or con substatiation he didn t say we interpret this passage using our brains we think and reason and draw conclusions but we know that our brains are not perfect our thinking often leads us wrong this is something that most of us have direct experience of why should anyone believe that his reasoning which he knows to be fallible can lead him to perfect conclusions so given the assumptions in this example what we can be certain of is that jesus said this is my body beyond that once we start making up doctrines and using our brains to reason about what christ revealed we get into trouble unless you are infallible there are very few things you can be certain of to the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking they can not be certain that is the problem of seeming arrogant the non christians around us know that human beings make mistakes just as surely as we know it they do not believe we are infallible any more than we do when christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead them astray when we implicitly claim that we are infallible the non christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim witnessing is hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you are either too foolish to recognise your own limits or intentionally trying to cover them up i think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what things we are only very confident of for example we might say that we know our sin for recognising sin is something we directly experience but other things whether based on reasoning from scripture or extra biblical thinking should not be labled as infallible we should say that we are very confident of them and be ready to explain our reasoning but so far as i am aware none of us is infallible speaking or acting as if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous rexlex suggested that people read _he is there and he is not silent_ by francis schaeffer i didn t think very highly of it but i think that mr schaeffer is grossly overrated by many evangelical christians somebody else might like it though so don t let my opinion stop you from reading it if someone is interested in my opinion i d suggest _on certainty_ by ludwig wittgenstein darren f provine if any substantial number of talk religion misc readers read some wittgenstein of the postings would disappear if they understood some wittgenstein would disappear michael l siemon",435

"from benedikt rosenau subject re gospel dating organization technical university braunschweig germany lines in article charley wingate writes well john has a quite different not necessarily more elaborated theology there is some evidence that he must have known luke and that the content of q was known to him but not in a canonized form this is a new argument to me could you elaborate a little the argument goes as follows q oid quotes appear in john but not in the almost codified way they were in matthew or luke however they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of q as such and not an entirely different source assuming that he knew luke would obviously put him after luke and would give evidence for the latter assumption i don t think this follows if you take the most traditional attributions then luke might have known john but john is an elder figure in either case we re talking spans of time here which are well within the range of lifetimes we are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors the usual explanation for the time order of mark matthew and luke does not consider their respective ages it says matthew has read the text of mark and luke that of matthew and probably that of mark as it is assumed that john knew the content of luke s text the evidence for that is not overwhelming admittedly earlier manuscripts of john have been discovered interesting where and which how are they dated how old are they unfortunately i haven t got the info at hand it was i think in the late s or early s and it was possibly as old as ce when they are from about why do they shed doubt on the order on putting john after the rest of the three i don t see your point it is exactly what james felder said they had no first hand knowledge of the events and it obvious that at least two of them used older texts as the base of their account and even the association of luke to paul or mark to peter are not generally accepted well a genuine letter of peter would be close enough wouldn t it sure an original together with id card of sender and receiver would be fine so what s that supposed to say am i missing something and i don t think a one step removed source is that bad if luke and mark and matthew learned their stories directly from diciples then i really can not believe in the sort of big transformation from jesus to gospel that some people posit in news reports one generally gets no better information than this and if john is a diciple then there s nothing more to be said that john was a disciple is not generally accepted the style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument the argument that john was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel of john itself is there any other evidence for it one step and one generation removed is bad even in our times compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources it is also obvious that mark has been edited how old are the oldest manuscripts to my knowledge which can be antiquated the oldest is quite after any of these estimates and it is not even complete the only clear editing is problem of the ending and it s basically a hopeless mess the oldest versions give a strong sense of incompleteness to the point where the shortest versions seem to break off in midsentence the most obvious solution is that at some point part of the text was lost the material from verse on is pretty clearly later and seems to represent a synopsys of the end of luke in other words one does not know what the original of mark did look like and arguments based on mark are pretty weak but how is that connected to a redating of john benedikt",470

"organization penn state university from andrew newell subject re free moral agency distribution na lines in article bill conner says dean kaflowitz wrote now what i am interested in is the original notion you were discussing on moral free agency that is how can a god punish a person for not believing in him when that person is only following his or her nature and it is not possible for that person to deny what his or her reason tells him or her which is that there is no god i think you re letting atheist mythology confuse you on the issue of webster myth a traditional or legendary story a belief whose truth is accepted uncritically how does that qualify indeed it s almost oxymoronic a rather amusing instance i ve found that most atheists hold almost no atheist views as accepted uncritically especially the few that are legend many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do but they don t meet the other criterions also divine justice according to the most fundamental doctrines of christianity when the first man sinned he was at that time the you accuse him of referencing mythology then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology this time meeting all the requirements of myth salvation the idea of punishment is based on the proposition that everyone knows instinctively that god exists is their creator and ah but not everyone knows that god exists so you have a fallacy there s nothing terribly difficult in all this and is well known to any reasonably biblically literate christian the only controversy is and that makes it true holding with the bible rules out controversy read the faq if you ve read it you missed something so re read not a bad suggestion for anyone i re read it just before this with those who pretend not to know what is being said and what it means when atheists claim that they do not know if god exists and don t know what he wants they contradict the bible which clearly says that everyone knows the authority of the bible is its claim to be should i repeat what i wrote above for the sake of getting it across you may trust the bible but your trusting it doesn t make it any more credible to me if the bible says that everyone knows that s clearly reason to doubt the bible because not everyone knows your alleged god s alleged existance refuted while the species wide condemnation is justified those that claim that there is no evidence for the existence of god or that his will is unknown must deliberately ignore the bible the ignorance itself is no excuse no they don t have to ignore the bible the bible is far from universally accepted the bible is not a proof of god it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god or does it prove even that they might have been writing it as series of fiction short stories as in the case of dionetics assuming the writers believed it the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it and that s ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and biblical philosophers were correct there are people who have truly never heard of the bible again read the faq freedom you are free to ignore god in the same way you are free to ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known in both cases that an atheist can t accept the evidence means only bzzt wrong answer gravity is directly there it doesn t stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it god on the other hand doesn t generally show up in the supermarket except on the tabloids god doesn t exert a rationally undeniable influence gravity is obvious gods aren t secondly human reason is very comforatble with the concept of god so much so that it is in itself intrinsic to our nature human reason always comes back to the question of god in every generation and in no human reason hasn t always come back to the existance of god it has usually come back to the existance of god in other words it doesn t generally come back to the xtian god it comes back to whether there is any god and in much of oriental philosophic history it generally doesn t pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there from a world wide view human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and or what force s are currently in control a natural tendancy to believe in god only exists in religious wishful thinking i said all this to make the point that christianity is eminently reasonable that divine justice is just and human nature is much different than what atheists think it is whether you agree or not xtianity is no more reasonable than most other religions and it s reasonableness certainly doesn t merit eminence divine justice well it only seems just to those who already believe in the divinity first not all atheists believe the same things about human nature second whether most atheists are correct or not you certainly are not correct on human nature you are at the least basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach try looking at the outside world as well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity andrew",475

"from carter c page subject re reason vs revelation organization university of pennsylvania lines in article trajan stephen mcintyre writes in article writes i can only reply with what it says in timothy i m not here to discount parts of the bible rather i m here only to discount the notion of revelation the author of timothy told what he thought was the truth based on his belief in god his faith in jesus as the resurrected son and his readings of the old testament but again what had been revealed to him was based on at best second hand information given by friends and authors who may not have given the whole truth or who may have exaggerated a bit first of all the original poster misquoted the reference is from tim the author was paul and his revelations were anything but at best second hand and is came about that as saul journeyed he was approaching damascus and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him and he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him saul saul why are you persecuting me and he said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whom you are persecuting acts nas paul received revelation directly from the risen jesus pretty cool eh he became closely involved with the early church the leaders of which were followers of jesus throughout his ministry on earth now you may say the holy spirit revealed these things unto him and we could go into that argument but you d be hard pressed to convince me that the holy spirit exists i agree i don t believe anyone but the spirit would be able to convince you the spirit exists please don t complain about this being circular i know it is but really can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural this is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the bible additionally what he has written is again second hand info if it were given by the spirit and still carries the chance it is not true the spirit is part of god how much closer to the source can you get the greek in timothy which is sometimes translated as inspired by god literally means god breathed in other words god spoke the actual words into the scriptures many theologians and bible scholars dr james boice is one that i can remember off hand get quite annoyed by the dryness and incompleteness of inspired by god the only way you would be able to escape this notion of second hand info is to have had the entire bible written by god himself and to tell the truth i ve studied the bible extensively and have yet to hear of scholars who have put forth objective evidence showing god as the first author of this collection of books that s what the verse taken from timothy was all about the continuity of a book written over a span of years by more than authors from all walks of life is a testimony to the single authorship of god and as for reason read what it says in corinthians about human wisdom basically it says that human wisdom is useless when compared with what god has written for our learning if you knew of jesus as well as you know the bible you d realize he reasoned out the law and the prophets for the common man what source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior historicity to the bible certainly not josephus writings or the writings of the gnostics which were third century at the earliest and though some claim jesus was he was human with all of the human wisdom the apostle paul set out to criticize yet would you not embrace the idea that jesus was wise jesus was fully god as well that s why i d assert that he is wise i realise that you may not accept the authority of the bible this is unfortunate to say the least because there is no other way of learning about god and christ and god s purpose with the earth than reading the bible and searching out its truth for yourself for your information i was raised without any knowledge of god by the time some of the faithful came to show me the word and share with me its truth i was living happily and morally without acknowledging the existence of a supreme being i have though read the bible several times over in its entirety and have studied it thoroughly it contains truth in it and i consider jesus to be one of the most moral of human beings to have lived in fact i darn near idolize the guy but there s no rational reason for me to except god s existence please rethink this last paragraph if there is no god which seems to be your current belief then jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not only did he assert that god exists but he claimed to be god himself regards to c s lewis how then could you have the least bit of respect for jesus in conclusion be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based on gut feelings about the text and other scholars unsubstantiated claims the bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out about your reading of the bible not only does the spirit inspire the writers but he guides the reader as well we can not understand it in the least without the spirit s guidance for to us god revealed them through the spirit for the spirit searches all things even the depths of god cor nas peace and may god guide us in wisdom carter c page of happiness the crown and chiefest part is wisdom a carpenter s apprentice and to hold god in awe this is the law that seeing the stricken heart of pride brought down we learn when we are old adapted from sophocles other theologians get quite annoyed at the misleadingess of god breathed it s true that the greek word has as its roots god and breath however etymology doesn t necessarily tell you what a word means otherwise goodbye would be a religious expression since it comes from god be with ye you have to look at how the word was actually used in this case the word is used for wisdom or dreams that come from god but god breathed is an overtranslation clh",484

"from d andrew byler subject the nicene creed was re major views of the trinity organization freshman civil engineering carnegie mellon pittsburgh pa lines michael bushnell writes the so called creed of athanasius however has always been a western creed and has always had the filioque the orthodox have said that they accept all that it says with the exception of the filioque but it is not in use which is exactly what i pointed out though i was wrong about your use of the creed the catholic encylcopedia in which i read about it said the orthodox do use the creed minus the filioque apparently that has changed the athanasian creed has always had the filioque the nicene constantinopolitan did not of course the orthodox did not delete the filioque from the nicene creed it wasn t there to begin with but they certainly did from the athanasian creed which did have it from the beginning i might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in ways of explaining the generation of the blessed trinity the east emphasizing the idea of the holy spirit proceeding from the father through the son and the west using proceeding from the father and the son in fact some such as tertullian used both formulations see below following therefore the form of these examples i profess that i do call god and his word the father and and his son two for the root and the stem are two things but conjoined the fountain and the river are two kinds but indivisible the sun and the ray are two forms but coherent ones anything which proceeds from another must necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds but it is not on that account separated from it where there is second however there are two and where ther is third there are three the spirit then is third from god and the son just as the third from the root is the fruit of the stem and third from the fountain is the stream from the river and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray tertullian against praxeas about ad and i believe that the spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the father through the son tertullian against praxeas about ad and as st thomas showed in his summa theologica part question articles and there is no contradiction between the two methods of generation and in fact the two methods of reckoning the procession emphasize what st augustine among others taught that the holy spirit proceeds from the father and the son but he proceeds from the father in a more preeminent way for whatever the son has he has from the father certainly he has it from the father that the holy spirit proceeds from him for the father alone is not from another for which reason he alone is called unbegotten not indeed in the scriptures but in the practice of theologians and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a matter so great the son however is born of the father and the holy spirit proceeds principally from the father and since the father gives to the son all that he has without any interval of time the holy spirit proceeds jointly from both father and son he would be called son of the father and of the son if which is abhorent to everyone of sound mind they had both begotten him the spirit was not begotten by each however but proceeds from each and both st augustine of hippo the trinity to ad so in a sense all of the formulations are correct to the west at least because the holy spirit proceeds from both father and son but in proceeding from the son the orgin of that procession is the procession from the father so the holy spirit is proceeding from the father through the son but as all that the son has is from the father the holy spirit can be said to proceed from the father without any mention of the son being necessary in any case i am happy to know that i follow in the beliefs of pope st leo i st fulgence of ruspe st cyril of alexandria pope st damsus i st augustine of hippo st epiphanius of salamis st ambrose of milan st hilary of poitiers tertullian and others among the fathers who all have very quotable quotes supporting the catholic position which i enunciated above as for the issue of the adoption of another creed being forbidden i will point out that the holy fathers of ephesus and chalcedon both spoke of the creed of nicea in their statement forbidding anyone to produce write or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by the fathers of nicea that creed is a different creed than that of constantinople which is commonly called the nicene creed not of course in that they were condemning the adoption of the constantinopolitan creed which is but an enlargement upon the creed of nicea but that they were condemning the impious opinions of nestorious who had adopted a radically different creed from the one used by the church which among other things denied the procession of the holy spirit form the son thus the additions of the constantinopolitan creed were not thought to be in violation of this and as the council chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the holy spirit from the son which nestorius denied they could hardly have been against explaining in a fuller way the creed for they themselves approved of previous additions to it and if the further explanations of the creed made in constantinople were not denigrating of the work done by the holy fathers of nicea or in any way heretical it follows that the council of toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed by the faithful to the creed so as to combat the impieties of the arians in spain because the filioque was not in dispute in the church until many years later under photius and others and that the filioque was not disputed i provide more quotes below since the holy spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to god and he actually proceeds from the father and son it is abundantly clear that he is of the divine essence in it in essence and proceeding from it st cyril of alexandria the treasury of the holy and consubstantial trinity thesis ad the holy spirit is not of the father only or of the son only but he is the spirit of the father and the son for it is written if anyone loves the world the spirit of the father is not in him and again it is written if anyone however does not have the spirit of christ he is none of his when the father and the son are named in this way the holy spirit is understood of whom the son himself says in the gospel that the holy spirit proceeds from the father and that he shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you pope st damasus i the decree of damasus ad the only begotten holy spirit has neither the name of the son nor the appelation of father but is called holy spirit and is not foreign to the father for the only begotten himself calls him the spirit of the father and says of him the he proceeds from the father and will receive of mine so that he is reckoned as not being foreign to the son but is of their same substance of the same godhead he is spirit divine of god and he is god for he is spirit of god spirit of the father and spirit of the son not by some kind of synthesis like soul and body in us but in the midst of father and son of the father and of the son a third by appelation the father always existed and the son always existed and the spirit breathes from the father and the son and neither is the son created nor is the spirit created st epiphanius of salamis which is on cyprus the man well anchored and ad concerning the holy spirit i ought not to remain silent nor yet is it necessary to speak still on account of those who do not know him it is not possible for me to be silent however it is necessary to speak of him who must be acknowledged who is from the father and the son his sources st hilary of poitiers the trintiy to ad thus as i have pointed out before gaul spain italy africa egypt palastine and the lands of the greeks all of christnedom at that time all have fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine expressed by the filioque i suggest to those of the orthodox church that they come up with some of the fathers besides st john of damascus who all will admit denied the filioque to support their views it is not enough to bring up the proceeds from the father line of the creed or the gospel of john for that says what we believe also but it does not say the holy spirit does not proceed from the son only that he does proceed from the father andy byler",540
"from rathmann janice e subject re sinus vs migraine was re sinus endoscopy organization bellcore livingston nj summary headaches and analgesics lines i noticed several years ago that when i took analgesics fairly regularly motrin at the time i seemed to get a lot of migraines but had forgotten about that until i started reading some of the posts here i generally don t take nsaids or tylenol for headaches because i ve found them to be ineffective however i have two other pain sources that force me to take nsaids currently naprosyn first is some pelvic pain that i get at the beginning of my period and then much worse at midcycle i have had surgery for endometriosis in the past years ago so the drs tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back i ve tried synarel it reduced the pain while i took it mos but the pain returned immediately after i stopped three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only real solution to my problem although i don t expect to have any more children i don t like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed the first ovary was removed when i had the surgery for endometriosis one of the drs that suggested i get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children so basically all i m left with is toughing out the pain this would be impossible without naprosyn or something similar but not aspirin that doesn t work and motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago so i m through with it in fact naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if i take it regularly as i did when i had severe back pain and pain in both legs as i ll discuss in a moment generally though i wait until i have the pain before i take the naprosyn but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain it s actually quite effective at reducing the pain it just takes quite a while in the meantime i m frequently in severe pain the other pain source i have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy i ve had mris xrays ct scan and emgs i ve had of them and don t intend to ever do that again with nerve conduction tests the tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain the mri reports both say i have several bulging degeneratig disks and from the xrays and mri i think it is apparent that i have arthritis the reading on the ct scan was that there are two herniations l l and l l but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations the second emg and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first emg oh yeah i had some other horrible test called something like somatic evoked response which showed that the internal nerves are working fine anyway the bottom line is that i sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain the back pain is there all the time but i can live with it when the leg pain is there i need some analgesic anti inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where i can work so i took naprosyn regulary for months every time i tried to stop the leg pain got worse so i d always resume since last november i have taken it much less frequently and primarily for the pelvic pain i have been going to physical therapy for the last months times a week after the first month or so my therapist put me on pelvic traction she had tried it earlier but it had caused a lot of pain in my back this time she tried it at a lower weight after a month or two the pain in my legs began going away but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage so now i don t have nearly as much pain in my legs in fact my therapist took me off traction about weeks ago getting back to my original reason for this post even if i can avoid taking analgesic for headaches i really can t avoid them entirely because i have other pain sources that force me to use them oh i forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that i have back surgery but i m avoiding that too i find the migraines difficult to deal with occassionally i have to take off work but usually i can work but at a reduced capacity i m a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing when the pelvic pain is bad i can t concentrate much i usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes because the pain is so bothersome when the pain in my back is bad it can cause severe burning in both legs shooting pains in my legs electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes and basically when it gets bad i can t really sit at all then i end up spending most of my time home and in bed so even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources i get a lot of migraines an average of to a month which last days i ve taken cafergot the first time the caffiene really got to me so i reduced the dosage but i don t like the side effects if i take more than two i get diahrea if i get a very bad headache i will eventually take the cafergot my neurologist wasn t very helpful when i told him my problems with cafergot he said that when sumatriptan becomes available i should try that i ve tried several other medications fiornal midrin fiornal with codeine tegretol and inderal but they either didn t work or i couldn t tolerate them so what can i do my doctor s seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain which i agree with most of the time but not when i have a lot of pain i ve had some bad experiences with surgery my heart stopped once from the anesthesia i was told that it was likely the succinylcholine and i ve already had surgery several times anyway the point of what i m saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines some people need to take them to tolerate other pain janice rathmann",541

"from fred rice subject re why is sex only allowed in marriage rationality was islamic marriage organization monash university melb australia lines in lucio de re writes fred rice writes my point of view is that the argument all sexism is bad just simply does not hold let me give you an example how about permitting a woman to temporarily leave her job due to pregnancy should that be allowed it happens to be sexist as it gives a particular right only to women nevertheless despite the fact that it is sexist i completely support such a law because i think it is just fred you re exasperating sexism like racialism is a form of discrimination using obvious physical or cultural differences to deny one portion of the population the same rights as another in this context your example above holds no water whatsoever there s no discrimination in denying men maternity leave in fact i m quite convinced that were anyone to experiment with male pregnancy it would be possible for such a future father to take leave on medical grounds okay i argued this thoroughly about weeks ago men and women are different physically physiologically and psychologically much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book brainsex by anne moir and david jessel i recommend you find a copy and read it their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced now if women and men are different in some ways the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different maternity leave is an example of this it takes into account that women get pregnant it does not give women the same rules it would give to men because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust this is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different now people make the _naive_ argument that sexism oppression however maternity leave is sexist because men do not get pregnant men do not have the same access to leave that women do not to the same extent or degree and therefore it is sexist no matter however much a man _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave he never can and therefore the law is sexist no man can have access to maternity leave no matter how hard he tries to get pregnant i hope this is clear maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just because the sexism here just reflects the sexism of nature in making men and women different there are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy and to find out more of these i recommend you have a look at the book brainsex your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious if men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women to have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is so your argument when it is examined is seen to be fallacious you are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that women can have if they also become women which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist the discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities because of her legally determined sexual inferiorities as i understand most religious sexual discrimination and i doubt that islam is exceptional the female is not allowed into the priestly caste and in general is subjugated so that she has no aspirations to rights which as an equal human she ought to be entitled to there is no official priesthood in islam much of this function is taken by islamic scholars there are female islamic scholars and female islamic scholars have always existed in islam an example from early islamic history is the prophet s widow aisha who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an islamic scholar no matter how sweetly you coat it part of the role of religions seems historically to have served the function of oppressing the female whether by forcing her to procreate to the extent where there is no opportunity for self improvement or by denying her access to the same facilities the males are offered you have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions and i dispute it i could go on and on about women in islam etc but i recently reposted something here under the heading islam and women if it is still at your news site i suggest you read it it is reposted from soc religion islam so if it has disappeared from alt atheism it still might be in soc religion islam i forgot what its original title was though i will email it to you if you like the roman catholic church is the most blatant of the culprit because they actually istitutionalised a celibate clergy but the other religious are no different let a woman attempt to escape her role as child bearer and the wrath of god descends on her your statement that other religions are no different is i think a statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than christianity and perhaps judaism i ll accept your affirmation that islam grants women the same rights as men when you can show me that any muslim woman can aspire to the same position as say khomeini and there are no artificial religious or social obstacles on her path to achieve this aisha who i mentioned earlier was not only an islamic scholar but also was at one stage a military leader show me the equivalent of hillary rhodam clinton within islam and i may consider discussing the issue with you the prophet s first wife who died just before the hijra the prophet s journey from mecca to medina was a successful businesswoman

"from subject re what was the immaculate conception organization at t bell labs lines in article writes your roommate is correct the immaculate conception refers to the conception of mary in her mother s womb okay now that we ve defined the immaculate conception doctrine would it be possible for those more knowledgeable in the area to give the biblically or other support for it i ve attempted to come to terms with it previously in an attempt to understand it for learning purposes and haven t been able to grasp the reasoning it was a gift from god i think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the church held that mary was also without sin as was jesus as the tenets of faith developed particularly with augustine sin was more and more equated with sex and thus mary was assumed to be a virgin for life since she never sinned and since she was the spouse of god etc since we also had this notion of original sin ie that man is born with a predisposition to sin and since mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin she didn t have original sin when science discovered the process of conception the next step was to assume that mary was conceived without original sin the immaculate conception mary at that time appeared to a girl named bernadette at lourdes she refered to herself as the immaculate conception since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the doctrine the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine rcs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources that being sacred scripture and holy tradition in this case mostly tradition joe moore",565

"from family magazine sysops subject the empty tomb reply to family magazine sysops organization st elizabeth hospital youngstown oh lines the empty tomb can we trust it by the late wilbur m smith d d when jesus was on earth he made an amazing prediction about himself and frequently repeated it let me quote it for you behold we go up to jerusalem and the son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again matthew wholly different from the normal experience of men jesus who had never done anything worthy of death even deserving reproval knew he would die before he was years of age he knew the very city where he would die he knew that the religious leaders of his own race would condemn him to death he knew that one of his own would betray him he knew that before his actual death took place he would be mocked and scourged he knew exactly how he would die by crucifixion all this is in itself remarkable but more amazing than the minute particulars of his foreknowledge was what he predicted would follow shortly after he was buried that he would rise again he even designated the time on the third day but since it is on this central fact the death and resurrec tion of jesus christ that the whole truth or untruth of chris tianity turns let us examine it more closely the body of jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and ointments was distributed the body was placed in a tomb which had never before been used and a great stone was rolled against the entrance the jewish authorities fully aware that jesus had predicted he would rise again had the stone officially sealed and on saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the disciples from carrying away the body early sunday morning some of the women who were faithful followers of christ went out to the tomb to further anoint the body to their utter astonishment they found the stone rolled away the body gone they rushed back to tell the disciples shortly two of jesus friends peter and john utterly skeptical about the whole affair came and found the tomb empty just as the women had said even the guards came hurrying into the city to tell the sanhedrin that had hired them to guard the tomb that the body was gone matthew how did this tomb become empty one of the most famous new testament scholars in america professor of new testament literature in a large theological seminary wrote to the author in answer to my question of how the tomb became empty and wrote it in a letter not marked by bitterness or sarcasm that he could no more explain how the tomb became empty than he could explain how santa claus comes down the chimney at christmas time but he didn t realize that santa clause never did come down any chimney at christmas time because there never was a santa claus and there is a jesus he died he was buried in the tomb of joseph of arimathea and on sunday the body was gone those are facts of history no one can escape the responsi bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old another professor dr kirsopp lake of harvard university tried to explain the empty tomb by saying what no other scholar in the field of new testament criticism has ventured to adopt that the women went to the wrong tomb the facts are these first so far as we know there was no other tomb nearby to which by mistake they could have gone second it is contrary to all similar experience for three or more people to forget the place where they have buried their dearest loved one within less than three days even if the women did miss the tomb when peter and john came did they too go to the wrong tomb third were the soldiers guarding the wrong tomb there is of course a record of an attempt to escape the evidence of the empty tomb in the new testament itself now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done and when they were assembled with the leaders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governor s ears we will persuade him and secure you so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is com monly reported among the jews until this day matthew this is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the fact that the tomb was empty you will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never questioned but that the tomb was empty they never even went out to see if what the guards had reported was true they knew it was true another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that the tomb was empty the soldiers were told to say that jesus disciples came and stole the body away while they the soldiers were asleep how could they know what was going on while they were asleep obviously such testimony would be valueless in any court even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject the explanation the very character and the later history of the disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away the body of jesus first as professor heffern points out the leaders of judaism in jerusalem who had put the lord jesus to death had nothing to offer to contradict these disciples as they continued to preach jesus and his resurrection because all jerusalem knew the tomb was empty if there had been trickery here sooner or later it would have been suspected then proved second surely one of the disciples even most of them would have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent it may be possible to live a lie but men seldom die for a lie and most of these men did the result ultimately would have been that the message that christ had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories it would have lost it power instead this truth swept the world closed pagan temples won millions of disciples brought hope to a despairing humanity was the very foundation truth of the early church and is today as believable and as freshly glorious as ever but not only did jesus come alive again he did not disappear to leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to what had happened to him instead he appeared to them literally visibly frequently he appeared to the women at the tomb on resurrection morning matthew later that day to mary magdalene alone john and to simon peter also alone luke in the afternoon he walked with two of his followers toward emmaus luke and that night he appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper room at jerusalem mark luke etc a week later he appeared to all eleven of the apostles probably at the same place john once he was seen by above brethren on a mountain in galilee i corinthians and finally to the apostles just before his ascension mark luke acts as with the fact of the empty tomb so in regard to these histor ically recorded appearances all kinds of theories have been proposed attempting to deny their literalness but these theories are unreasonable without supporting evidence none has ever won the unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the appearances moreover while it is true we are living in an age when may of our leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are antisuperanaturalistic let us not forget that some of the greatest thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle increase mather president of harvard timothy dwight president of yale nathan lord president of dartmouth edward hitchcock president of amherst mark hopkins president of williams john witherspoon president of princeton these men and countless others have believed it but suppose christ did rise from the dead what of it what has it to do with my life what has it to do with your life just this it seals with certitude the teachings of christ jesus taught many great truths especially many about himself he claimed to have come down from god he said he was the way to god he said he was the son of god who alone knew god perfectly he said that whoever believed on him had eternal life and no one else had it he said that whatever we ask god in his name he would grant it to us thus when he did rise from the grave on the third day he revealed that in these amazing unparalleled predictions he spoke the truth do you know any reason any good reason why we should not believe that his words are all true the point is does not the truth of the resurrection convince us that he is none other than the one he claimed to be the son of god and then of course the fact that christ rose from the dead testifies that he has broken the power of death and that he will some day raise us also up from the grave as he promised in other words if this person jesus christ the son of god in all this he should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life for he said a life built on him would know forgiveness of sins his compan ionship and help a joy that no circumstances can ever take away and a hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day those who have tried it down through the ages and there have been many have given their testimony and we today who believe also

not think there s unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day as i indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited whereas the ten commandments and jesus words in matt are fairly clear are they not are they clear or do you have doubts no i don t believe that paul can overrule god an important first step the realization that paul was human however paul was writing for a largely gentile audience yes and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best very weak in the faith most could not read most were unfamiliar with the hebrew scriptures in even the septuagint form paul adapted the message of the bible to a largely uneducated market granted this market still exists today but do you count yourself as part of it to be weak in the faith is not missing the mark hamartia if you do the best that your education allows are you doing the best the law was regarded by jews at the time and now as binding on jews but not on gentiles there are rules that were binding on all human beings the so called noachic laws but they are quite minimal let me make clear that the law is none other than the pentateuch of genesis exodus leviticus numbers deuteronomy what did jesus say about the law in matt where did jesus say that the law only applies to jews and that gentiles are above the law the issue that the church had to face after jesus death was what to do about gentiles who wanted to follow christ the decision not to impose the law on them didn t say that the law was abolished it simply acknowledged that fact that it didn t apply to gentiles who acknowledged this fact on what basis are we extra biblical at this point why not also acknowledge that the bhagavad gita is the only relevant text for gentiles after all we see in the bible that it was magus from the east who observed the star signs of jesus why bother with any texts at all why not just follow whatever the church has to say thus there is no contradiction with mat i don t see how you can say this with a straight face are you a follower of christ or do you follow someone else are you saying that the words of jesus only apply to jews as far as i can tell both paul and other jewish christians did continue to participate in jewish worship on the sabbath thus they continued to obey the law how jewish was paul after he changed his name from saul the issue was and is with gentile christians who are not covered by the law or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it who says gentile christians are not covered by the first five books who says that gentile christians are above the ten commandments jesus dealt mostly with jews i think we can reasonably assume that mat was directed to a jewish audience you re implying that jesus words are valid only for jews is this really what you mean to say you do realize that you are gutting rather large portions of the bible when you read jesus words did you ever consider that maybe just maybe jesus is talking to you no matter what your race or sex if the hebrew scriptures and the gospel accounts of jesus are only directed to jews why were they translated into english he did interact with gentiles a few times e g the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others the terms used to describe the centurion see luke suggest that he was a god fearer i e a gentile who followed god but had not adopted the whole jewish law as paul would call him one who was weak in the faith he was commended by jewish elders as a worthy person and jesus accepted him as such this seems to me to indicate that jesus accepted the prevailing view that gentiles need not accept the law which is more important the recorded word of jesus or indications that you can deduce from the bible was jesus god only of the jews or god of all humankind of all race and sex however there s more involved if you want to compare jesus and paul on the law in order to get a full picture of the role of the law we have to come to grips with paul s apparent rejection of the law and how that relates to jesus commendation of the law at least as i read paul he says that the law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded this is your understanding of paul compare this to the word of jesus are you christian or pauline again this issue isn t one of the abolition of the law in the middle of his discussion paul notes that he might be understood this way and assures us that that s not what he intends to say rather he sees the law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness but ultimately it s an impossible standard and one that has been superceded by christ again this is your understanding of paul did jesus say that the law was an impossible standard did jesus say that he superceded the law are you christian or pauline paul s comments are not the world s clearest here and not everyone agrees with my reading you acknowledge that it is your reading of paul what did jesus say can you deny that matt is quite clear in its meaning are you christian or pauline but the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the law it still remains as an uncompromising standard from which not an iota or dot may be removed for its purpose of convicting of sin it s important that it not be relaxed when did jesus say that the purpose of the law was conviction of sin however for christians it s not the end ultimately we live in faith not law please reread matt are you christian or pauline jesus interpretations emphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonial details are you saying that the ten commandments are ceremonial details paul s conclusion is similar while he talks about the law being superceded all of the specific examples he gives involve the ceremonial law such as circumcision and the sabbath he is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards you call observance of the sabbath the day on which the lord rested ceremonial has circumcision been superceded for christians are you christian or pauline both there is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not at least not in this case jesus did not deal explicitly with the question of whether the law was binding on gentiles that s why i have to cite evidence such as the way jesus dealt with the centurion as to general jewish views on this i am dependent largely on studies of pauline theology one by h j schoeps and one whose author i can t come up with at the moment both authors are jews also various christian and non christian jews have discussed the issue here and in other newsgroups mat is clear that the law is still valid it does not say that it applies to gentiles and yes i say that the specific requirement for worship on the sabbath in the ten commandments is a ceremonial detail when you re looking at the obligations of gentiles similarly circumcision i m not sure quite what else i can say on this subject again it s unfortunate the jesus didn t answer the question directly however we do know what the st cent jewish approach was how jesus dealt with at least one gentile and how jesus disciples dealt with the issue when it became more acute i m referring to acts more than paul given that these are all in agreement i don t see that there s a big problem clh",614

"from d andrew byler subject monophysites and mike walker lines mike walker if you are using the standard formula of fully god and fully human that i m not sure why you object to saying that jesus was human i think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity it s a consequence of the fall jesus is human but not a fallen human clh the proper term for what mike expresses is monophysitism this was a heresy that was condemned in the council of chalcedon in ad it grew up in reaction to nestorianism which held that the son and jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily monophysitism is held by the copts of egypt and ethipoia and by the jacobites of syria and the armenian orthodox it believes that jesus christ was god which is correct that he was man which is correct that he was one person which is correct but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy which is heretical the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies both divine and human though the wills were in perfect harmony that is what mike is trying to get across that while jesus came in human form mike says he did not have a human nature or a human will in reality he had both though neither made him subject to original sin it is interesting to note that the monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies it also was condemned at a late council in constantinople i believe andy byler these issues get mighty subtle when you see people saying different things it s often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things or whether they are using different terminology i don t think there s any question that there is a problem with nestorius and i would agree that the saying christ had a human form without a real human nature or will is heretical but i d like to be a bit wary about the copts armenians etc recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought nestorius was an extreme representative of one of the two major schools of thought more moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox e g theodore of mopsuestia my impression is that the modern monophysite groups inherit the entire tradition not just nestorius version and that some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as orthodox clh",644

"from john e murray subject quality of catholic liturgy organization the ohio state university lines i would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my wife and me lately liturgy in particular catholic liturgy in the last few years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during mass it s driving me crazy the most grace filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we _all_ do together because we all know how to do it led by the priest of course which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to god but the best masses i ve been to were participatory prayers lately i think the proportion of participation has fallen and the proportion of sitting there and watching or listening or generally being told what to do which is necessary because no one knows what s happening next is growing example last sunday palm sunday we went to the local church usually on palm sunday the congregation participates in reading the passion taking the role of the mob the theology behind this seems profound when we say crucify him we mean it we did it and if he came back today we d do it again it always gives me chills but last week we were invited to sit during the gospel passion and _listen_ besides the orwellian invitation i was really saddened to have my and our little role taken away this seems typical of a shift of participation away from the people and toward the musicians readers and so on new things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows what s happening the new things have to be explained and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the mass we re just sitting there listening or spacing out in my case to how the mass is about to be done in my mind i lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay experts but that may not be just i do think that a liturgy committee has a bias toward doing something rather than nothing that s just a fact of bureaucratic life even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for people to be aware of the lord s presence so we ve been wondering are we the oddballs or is the quality of the mass going down i don t mean that facetiously we go to mass every thursday or friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of god s presence but as far as the obligatory sunday masses maybe i should just offer it up has anyone else noticed declining congregational participation in catholic masses lately john murray",659

"from keith allan schneider subject re political atheists organization california institute of technology pasadena lines nntp posting host punisher caltech edu jon livesey writes much though it might be fun to debate capital punishment itself this is probably the wrong group for it the only relevance here is that you don t seem to be able to tell us what capital punishment actually is and when it is murder that is when you tell us murder is wrong you are using a term you have not yet defined well i ve said that when an innocent person has been executed this is objectively a murder however who is at blame is another question it seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions realizing the risks is to blame there is a probability of killing an innocent person by shooting at random into the air and there is a probability of killing an innocent person when the state administers a system of capital punishment so when you do either you know that they actions you are taking will sooner or later result in the killing of an innocent person yes but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing any raondom activity presumably you had not isolated yourself totally from the rest of society because of this and driving will kill people as will airlines but people continue to do both driving and flying are not punishments inflicted on unwilling prisoners by courts they are risks that we take upon ourselves willingly and i argue that our law system is a similar risk perhaps an innocent person will be punished someday but we work to prevent this in fact many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment of innocents if our own driving kills someone else then sure there is a moral issue i know at least one person who was involved in a fatal accident and they felt vey guilty afterwards but such accidents are to be totally expected given the numner of vehicals on the road again the blame is on society no i m not this is what you said you were saying that if there were such a false witness that resulted in an innocent person being convicted and killed it would still be the fault of the state since it did the actual killing no i just commented that the state does the killing it does not depend on there being false witnesses how could it the state does the killing even in the case of sincere mistakes yes but the state is not at fault in such a case the state can only do so much to prevent false witnesses it is possible so what are you trying to say that capital punishment is always murder because of the possibilty of human error invalidating the system i m saying capital punishment is murder period not because of this that and the other but because it involves taking human life that s my definition of murder i make no appeals to dictionaries or to objective morals okay so this is what you call murder but the question is whether or not all such murders are wrong are you saying that all taking of human life is wrong no matter what the circumstances if we as a society decide to murder someone then we should say that and lists our reasons for doing so and live with the moral consequences we should not play word games and pretend that murder isn t murder and that s my opinion about how society ought to be run but this is basically how it works society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution and every member of society shares this blame and most people s definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent which is not involved in an execution is it but we were trying to discuss an objective moral system or at least its possibilty what ramifications does your personal system have on an objective one no we were not discussing an objective moral system i was showing you that you didn t have one because for one thing you were incapable of defining the terms in it for example murder murder violates the golden rule executions do not because by allowing it at all society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the innocent victim is we re not talking about reading minds we are just talking about knowing the truth yes we can never be absolutely certain that we have the truth but the court systems work on a principle of knowing the truth beyond a reasonable doubt sorry but you simply are not quoting yourself accurately here is what you said and since we are looking totally objectively at this case then we know what people are thinking when they are voting to execute the person or not if the intent is malicious and unfair then the execution would be murder what you are doing now is to slide into another claim which is quite different the jury being persuaded beyond a serious doubt is not the same as us knowing what is in their minds beyond a serious doubt reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not but in an objective system only the absolute truth matters and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth that is twelve members must be convinced of a truth moreover a jury which comes from a sufficiently prejudiced background may allow itself to be persuaded beyond a serious doubt on evidence that you and i would laugh at but then if we read the minds of these people we would know that the conviction was unfair but would it be perfectly fair if we could read minds if we assume that it would be fair if we knew the absolute truth why is it so much less fair in your opinion if we only have a good approximation of the absolute truth it s not a question of fairness your claim which i have quoted above is a claim about whether we can know it was fair so as to be able to distinguish capital punishnment from murder yes while we could objectively determine the difference if we knew all possible information we can t always determine the difference in our flawed system i think that our system is almost as good as possible but it still isn t objectively perfect you see it doesn t matter if we know it is fair or not objectively it is either fair or it is not now there s a huge difference if we can read minds we can know and if we can not read minds we can know nothing the difference is not in degree of fairness but in what we can know but what we know has no effect on an objective system i think it is possible to produce a fairly objective system if we are clear on which goals it is supposed to promote i m not going to waste my time trying to devise a system that i am pretty sure does not exist why are you so sure i simply want people to confront reality my reality remember why is your reality important in this case the reality is that ideal theories apart we can never know even after the fact about the fairness of the justice system for every innocent person released from death row there may have been a dozen innocent people executed or a hundred or none at all we simply don t know but we can assume that the system is fairly decent at least most likely and you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a totally ideal and objective system now what are we going to do on the one hand we can pretend that we have an ideal theory and that we can know things we can never know and the justie system is fair and that we can wave a magic wand and make certain types of killing not murder and go on our way well we can have an ideal system but the working system can not be ideal we can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to the ideal system as possible on the other hand we can recognize that all justice has a small we hope probability of punishing the innocent and that in the end we do bear moral responsibility even for the probabilistic consequences of the systems we set up and then say well here we go murdering again maybe some of us will even say gee i wonder if all this is strictly necessary yes we all bear the responsibility most people seem willing to do this i think that the second is preferable in that if requires people to face the moral consequences of what we do as a society instead of sheltering ourselves from them by magic ceremonies and word games we must realize the consequences of all our actions why do you keep separating the justice system from the pack and lest i forget i also don t think we have an objective moral system and i believe i only have to take that idea seriously when someone presents evidence of it i don t think our country has an objective system but i think such an objective system

"from subject assurance of hell organization fnal ad net lines i dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned and the trumpet had blown i dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment before the white throne oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate they cried for the rock and the mountains they prayed but their prayers were too late the soul that had put off salvation not tonight i ll get saved by and by no time now to think of religion alas he had found time to die and i saw a great white throne now some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation yet jesus thought it was paul thought it was paul said knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men today too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship we don t tell people anymore that there s such a thing as sin or that there s such a place as hell as jayne has said this doesn t mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball bat yet the fact remains there is a place called hell a place so fearful that god died to save us from having to experience it whatever you or i as christians do we should do whatever we can to win people to the lord if for no other reason to keep them from going to outer darkness jesus in mt tells us that he didn t prepare hell for people he prepared it for the devil and his angels no where in the bible do i read anywhere that god predestined anybody to go to hell d l moody use to say that the elect are the whosoever will and the nonelect are the whosoever wont s whether or not that s theologically sound i couldn t defend but its practical jesus said to the people of israel ye would not now some of you may not be students of the bible heck some of you may not be christians have you ever said to somebody i don t believe in hell i believe in the religion of jesus but did you know that jesus talked more about hell than he did about heaven oh i believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount you find hell taught by jesus in the sermon on the mount you ll read that jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire several times he talks about hell and about judgment in fact over and over in the synoptics matthew mark and luke jesus talks about hell not isaiah not moses not john the baptist though he did but jesus the son of god the great beloved one preached about hell because he loved people and didn t want to see them go there now if there is no hell then jesus preached in vain it was our lord jesus not some angry baptist preacher that said where the worm never dies and where the fire never goes out jesus said that it was jesus who called hell a furnace of fire it was jesus that used the word condemnation and this is the condemnation that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil jesus said that how can we get it across to you that a loving dying jesus preached about hell not only that but he went through hell that s what calgary was all about when my lord was on the cross darkness fell he called hell outer darkness do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here the drunks are getting drunk over there and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there that s not what hell is hell s not a party there s no fellowship there he called it outer darkness outer away from god darkness god is light no when he was on the cross he was made sin for you and for me god treated jesus the way sinners have to be treated that s is a sobering thought as my son would say an awesome thought my god my god why hast thou forsaken me hell is isolation there s no fellowship in hell there s no friendship in hell there s no loving embrace in hell there s no hand shake in hell there s no word of encouragement in hell i thirst it goes much deeper than physical thirst hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction the man whose life was lived for drugs will crave it eternally the man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman s body will crave it eternally and not be satisfied one theologian has put it this way and i think it deserves merit what is hell hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost in a recent post i was trying to remember the founder of the word of life ministries i ve remembered his name jack wertzen and found that the illustration that i gave wasn t his his illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber s wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to jack they sing these songs and read bible verses and their praising this and that i can t stand it jack do you think god would send me to hell jack answered by saying yes i think he would of course the barber said what do you mean by that well if you can t stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to god now what would you do in heaven where they ll do it for eternity you d be miserable because god loves you he d put you where it would match what you really are it makes a man think the crucifixion of jesus christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross he performed an eternal act don t ask me how i don t know but he is god and he is the infinite eternal and when he died he died an infinite eternal death it is by that eternal act that he purchased eternal life for the whosoever wills he suffered eternal judgment a lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying everybody is going to be saved eventually universalism my bible says no he ll separate them the sheep from the goats after you die there s a probationary period in which god prepares you for heaven no my bible says that it is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment some of the cultist believe in annihilation after you die sssswish just like a mosquito you re squished out no in rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven i don t enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don t enjoy listening to them but we have to preach the entire word of god there is a place called hell if i could give one verse of scripture that could give any hope that people aren t going there i d give it to you but i haven t found it that fact that there is a place called hell the fact that our god is a god of holiness and must judge sin the fact that he has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we re responsible the fact that he has placed us in a uni verse that has purpose and design behind it the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that god himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications as i ve already mentioned if you are a christian you must worn others its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out knowing therefore the terror of lord we persuade men if you haven t accepted jesus are your savior you re taking an awful chance as i say to the jehovah witnesses who no longer frequent my door if you are right and i am wrong then i will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist but if i am right and you are wrong then you will die and suffer eternal damnation i don t mean to make fun at this point but its like dirty harry said you ve got to ask yourself do i feel lucky well do you a man s got to know his limitations don t be one of the whosoever wont s

"from gideon king subject should christians fight justifiable war organization university of otago lines i posted this a couple of weeks ago and it doesn t seem to have appeared on the newsgroup and i haven t had a reply from the moderator we were having intermittent problems with our mail at the time please excuse me if you have seen this before should christians fight last week alastair posted some questions about fighting and whether there are such things as justifiable wars i have started looking into these things and have jotted down my findings as i go i haven t answered all his questions yet and i know what i have here is on a slightly different tack but possibly i ll be able to get into it more deeply later and post some more info soon our duty to our neighbour do good to all men gal love our neighbour as ourselves matt act the part of the good samaritan luke toward any who may be in trouble we will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured man and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes people harm even medical corps of the army etc christians are by faith citizens of the commonwealth of israel ephesians and also recognise that god rules in the kingdoms of men and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith we are to be strangers and pilgrims amongst the nations so we are just passing through and not part of any nation or any national aspirations this can also be applied to politics etc but that s another story we are not supposed to strive or resist evil even suffer yourselves to be defrauded it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in preserving a state which christ will destroy when he returns to set up god s kingdom our duty to the state render therefore unto caesar the things which be caesar s and unto god the things which be god s luke let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of god whosoever resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of god rom submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord s sake whether it be to king as supreme for so is the will of god that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men pet these scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a divine command but it is equally clear from acts that when any ordinance of man runs counter to god s law we must refuse submission to it the reason for this is that we are god s bond servants and his service is our life s task an example of the type of thing is in col where bondservants were to work heartily as unto the lord so also we should work as if our boss was god i e pressed down shaken together and running over oops a bit of a side track there in the contests between the nations we are on god s side a side that is not fighting in the battle but is testifying to the truth when we believe in god and embrace his promises we become fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are no longer interested in associations of the world think of this in relation to unions etc as well paul tells us to lay aside every weight that we may run the race that is set before us and if we are wise we will discard any association which would retard our progress thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of jesus christ no man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier tim one of these entanglements he warns about is be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers one of the obvious applications of this is marriage with unbelievers but it also covers things like business partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association with any person or persons not believing the truth about god in this case the army the principle comes from deut remember that as well as them being different animals of different strengths one was clean and one unclean under the law these ideas are strongly stressed in cor i suggest you read this the yoking also has another aspect that of servitude and jesus says take my yoke upon you so we are then yoked with christ and can not be yoked with unbelievers we have already seen that we are bondservants of christ and paul says become not ye the bondservants of men cor rv an example from the old testament the question is asked in chr shouldest thou help the ungodly the situation here is a good example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life here are the facts he had made an affinity with ahab who had sold himself to work wickedness before the lord kings when asked by ahab to form a military alliance he had agreed and said i am as thou art my people as thy people kings an unequal yoking he sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted on hearing the prophet of the lord trying to do the right thing he found that he was yoked and therefore couldn t break away from the evil association he had made god says to us come out from among them and be ye separate and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and ye shall be my sons and daughters cor this is more or less what i have found out so far i m still looking into it as i don t think i ve answered all the questions raised by alastair yet heres a summary and a few things to think about the christian in under command obedience to this command is an essential factor in his relationship with christ john total dedication to this course of action is required romans disobedience compromises the close relationship between christ and his followers pet we are to be separated to god rom this involves a master servant relationship rom no man can serve two masters matt all that is in the kosmos is lust and pride quite opposed to gos john christs kingdom is not of this world i e not worldly in nature if it was his servants would fight to deliver him if christ is our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom was not of this world then his servants can not possibly fight for another master strangers and pilgrims have no rights and we can not swear allegiance to anyone but god the servant of the lord must not war but be gentle to all tim this does not just apply to war but also to avoiding strife throughout our lives there is a war to be waged not with man s weapons cor but with god s armour eph i ll probably post some more

"from mark fulk subject re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition organization university of rochester in article gary merrill writes in article mark fulk writes what is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhaps even the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common the crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren t of any use unless they make you do some experiments i ve known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they won t admit out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beers simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dna electrophoresis gel of human alu fragments he got very excited hoping that he d seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays the result was a well conserved or so bp sequence that occurs about times in the human genome unfortunately for warren s fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome on the other hand the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized and the standard method of recognizing human dna was created other species have different sets of transposons fortunately for me warren and i used to eat dinner at t g i fridays all the time it further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes forward and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs by generating in a completely non rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the critical function of science i m not sure that it s random but there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses if you are really working in an unknown area it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true under those circumstances the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have if they are wrong you will find out soon enough but at least you will find out _something_ if you try to do experiments at random with no prior conceptions at all in mind you will probably get nowhere though why this critical function should be less subject to the non rational forces is a mystery unfortunately the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non rational forces then we get varieties of pathological science lysenko mirsky s opposition to dna as gene cold fusion and so forth if experimental design hypotheses creation and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds then this must be equally true of the application of any critical function concerning replication this is what leads one ala feyerabend to an anything goes view i don t agree that this follows in fact this is _exactly_ the point at which i disagree with feyerabend it is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one s jealousies out of the refereeing process failures there are aplenty but on the whole things work out another point there are a couple of senses of the phrase experimental design i d say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_ not design alexander fleming proc royal soc chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea fleming probably thought runny bottom runny nose what the hell it s worth a try but his method of looking for phage was well designed to detect anything phage like in fact he found lysozyme true the generation part can be totally irrational but typically it is not anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one s political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science it is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs irrational perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds the main examples i can think of are from modern high energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole mark a fulk university of rochester computer science department",746

"from frank decenso jr subject major views of the trinity organization youngstown state youngstown free net lines with frank s permission i have added some information here and in one case changed the order of his contributions in order to clarify the historical relationship of the views my comments are based primarily on william rusch s historical summary in the trinitarian controversy fortress i m going to save this as an faq clh major views of the trinity second century the writers of the nd cent are important because they set up much of the context for the later discussions justin martyr aristides athenagoras tatian and theophilus of antioch are known as the apologists their theology has often been described as logos theology based strongly on wording in john they took more or less a two phase approach through eternity the logos was with the father as his mind or thought this immanent word became expressed as god revealed himself in history ultimately in jesus thus jesus full distinction from the father only became visible in history though the logos had been present in god from eternity rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the final orthodox position but in a form which is less sophisticated because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the godhead irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the apologists however he was uncomfortable with the two stage approach he still viewed god as one personage with distinctions that did not become fully visible except through his process of self revelation the economy the distinctions are present in his essential nature irenaeus emphasized the holy spirit more than the apologists irenaeus views should probably be called economic trinitarianism though that term is normally used as below to refer to later developments third century clh dynamic monarchianism source theodotus adherents paul of samosota artemon socinus modern unitarians perception of god s essence the unity of god denotes both oneness of nature and oneness of person the son and the holy spirit therefore are consubstantial with the father s divine essence only as impersonal attributes the divine dunamis came upon the man jesus but he was not god in the strict sense of the word perception of god s subsistence the notion of a subsistent god is a palpable impossibility since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible the diversity of god is apparent and not real since the christ event and the work of the holy spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within god not to a hypostatic union asignation of deity eternality father unique originator of the universe he is eternal self existent and without beginning or end son a virtuous but finite man in whose life god was dynamically present in a unique way christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified holy spirit an impersonal attribute of the godhead no deity or eternality is ascribed to the holy spirit criticism s elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concerning the trinity categorically denies the deity of christ and of the holy spirit thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical doctrine of salvation in summary this probably best thought of as not being trinitarianism at all god is an undifferentiated one son and holy spirit are seen as simply names for the man jesus and the grace of god active in the church clh modalistic monarchianism source praxeas adherents noatus sabellius swedenborg scleiermacher united pentecostals jesus only perception of god s essence the unity of god is ultra simplex he is qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person this essence may be designated interchangeably as father son and holy spirit they are different names for but identical with the unified simplex god the three names are the three modes by which god reveals himself perception of god s subsistence the concept of a subsistent god is erroneous and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of god s modalistic manifesting of himself the paradox of a subsisting three in oneness is refuted by recognizing that god is not three persons but one person with three different names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama asignation of deity eternality father fully god and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of the only unique and unitary god son full deity eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another mode of the one god and identical with his essence he is the same god manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role incarnation holy spirit eternal god only as the tile designates the phase in which the one god in temporal sequence manifested himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification criticism s depersonalizes the godhead to compensate for its trinitarian deficiencies this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical its concept of successive manifestations of the godhead can not account for such simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at christ s baptism rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy there are actually two slightly different groups included noetus and his followers and sabellius noetus was apparently more extreme sabellius followed him and attempted to use some features of economic trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view unfortunately information about sabellius comes from a century later and there seems to be some confusion between him and marcellus of ancyra clh i ve moved the following description to be with the other third century views it originally appeared near the end clh economic trinitarianism source hippolytus tertullian adherents various neo economic trinitarians perception of god s essence the godhead is characterized by triunity father son and holy spirit are the three manifestations of one identical indivisible substance the perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially comprehended in such manifest triadic deeds as creation and redemption perception of god s subsistence subsistence within the godhead is articulated by means of such terms as distinction and distribution dispelling effectively the notion of separateness or division asignation of deity eternality the equal deity of father son and holy spirit is clearly elucidated in observation of the simultaneous relational operational features of the godhead co eternality at times does not intelligibly surface in this ambiguous view but it seems to be a logical implication criticism s is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the relational aspect of the trinity note that this is a development of the apologists and irenaeus as mentioned above as with them the threeness is visible primarily in the various ways that god revealed himself in history however they did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow present in the godhead from the beginning tertullian talks of the father son and holy spirit as being three that are one in substance many people regard this view as being essentially orthodox but with less developed philosophical categories clh origen developing further an approach started by clement attempted to apply neo platonism to christian thought he set many of the terms of the coming battle in platonic fashion he sees the son as a mediator mediating between the absolute one of god and the plurality of creating beings the son is generated but he is eternally generated that is the relationship between father and son is eternal it can not be said that there was once when he was not a phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries having the son is intrinsic to his concept of god the father and son are described as separate hypostases though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts the union is one of love and action but there is some reason to think that he may have used the term homoousios of the same substance the holy spirit is also an active personal substance originated by the father through the son origen s intent is trinitarian not tritheistic but he pushes things in the direction of separateness fourth century clh subordinationism often called arianism clh source arius major adherents modern jehovah s witnesses and several other lesser known cults perception of god s essence the inherent oneness of god s nature is properly identifiable with the father only the son and the holy spirit are discreet entities who do not share the divine essence perception of god s subsistence the unipersonal essence of god precludes the concept of divine subsistence with a godhead threeness in oneness is self contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic god asignation of deity eternality father the only one unbegotten god who is eternal and without beginning son a created being and therefore not eternal though he is to be venerated he is not of the divine essence holy spirit a nonpersonal noneternal emanation of the father he is viewed as an influence an expression of god deity is not ascribed to him criticism s it is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting the deity of both christ and the holy spirit its hierarchial concept likewise asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the father christ and the holy spirit this results in a totally confused soteriology note also that in most versions of this view the son is not fully human either he is supernatural and sinless that distinguishes this view from adoptionism clh orthodox trinitarianism source athanasius adherents basil gregory of nyssa gregory of nazianzus augustine thomas aquinas luther calvin contemporary orthodox christianity perception of god s essence god s being is perfectly unified and simplex of one essence this essence of deity is held in common by father son and holy spirit the three persons are consubstantial coinherent co equal and co eternal perception of god s subsistence the divine subsistence is said to occur in three modes of being or hypostases as such the godhead exists undivided in divided persons this view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the godhead asignation of deity eternality in its final distillation this view unhesitatingly sets forth father son and holy spirit as co equal and co eternal in the godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function criticism s the only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in human language and thought itself the impossibility of totally describing the ineffable mystery of three in oneness at least in the th cent there were several different approaches all of which fit the description here and all regarded as orthodox but which are somewhat different in detail nicea was originally held to respond to arius arius can be thought of as carrying origen s thought a bit too far to the point of making the son a separate entity in general the east tended to take an approach based on origen s and it was hard to get acceptance of nicea in the east its final acceptance was based on the work of athanasius with the cappadocians gregory of nyssa and gregory of nazianzus among others while starting with three they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one must think of them as being a single god this allowed the council of constantinople in to get wide agreement on

"from lee lady subject re science and methodology summary merely avoiding mistakes doesn t get you anywhere organization university of hawaii mathematics dept expires mon may gmt lines in article michael holloway writes in article lee lady writes i would also like to point out that most of the arguments about science in sci med sci psychology etc are not about cases where people are rejecting scientific argument evidence proof they are about cases where no adequate scientific research has been done in some cases there is quite a bit of evidence but it isn t in a format to fit doctrinaire conceptions of what science is here it is again this indicates confusion between proof and the process of doing science you are making precisely one of the points i wanted to make i fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the process of science and the end result as an end result of science one wants to get results that are objectively verifiable but there is nothing objective about the process of science if good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable information but it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science this is where you and i disagree with turpin in order to have science one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science but they are merely the culmination of scientific research the most important part of true scientific methodology is scientific thinking without this one does not have any hypotheses worth testing no hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you re shaving or looking out the window at least not unless you ve done a lot of really good thinking beforehand the difference between a nobel prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology it depends on the quality of their thinking it really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies and it bothers me even more that there are many fields such as certain parts of psychology where there seems to be no thinking at all but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses and i m especially offended by russell turpin s repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes simply avoiding mistakes doesn t get you anywhere in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects",760

general purpose package for image processing which has been used for basically all the usual image processing applications robotics medical satellite engineering oil exploration etc it is called hips and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single images it has been growing since we first wrote it both by additions from us as well as a huge user contributed library feature description hips is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research system development and teaching it handles sequences of images movies in precisely the same manner as single frames programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations filtering convolution fourier and other transform processing edge detection and line drawing manipulation digital image compression and transmission methods noise generation and image statistics computation over such image transformation programs have been developed as a result almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and conveniently additionally hips allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines new users become effective using hips on their first day hips features images that are self documenting each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image hips includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of unix filters it comes complete with source code on line manual pages and on line documentation host configuration requirements originally developed at new york university hips now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently available it runs under the unix operating system it is modular and flexible provides automatic documentation of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special equipment hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and microvax sun apollo masscomp ncr tower iris ibm at etc for image display and input drivers are supplied for the grinnell and adage ikonas image processors and the sun sun sun and sun i consoles we also supply user contributed drivers for a number of other framestores and windowing packages sun gfx sun console matrox vip iti ip lexidata macintosh ii x windowing system and iris the hipsaddon package includes an interface for the crs it is a simple matter to interface hips with other frame stores and we can put interested users in touch with users who have interfaced hips with the arlunya and datacube max video hips can be easily adapted for other image display devices because of hips is machine independent availability hips has proven itself a highly flexible system both as an interactive research tool and for more production oriented tasks it is both easy to use and quickly adapted and

"from dave mielke subject does god love you organization bell northern research ottawa canada lines i have come across what i consider to be an excellent tract it is a bit lengthy for a posting but i thought i d share it with all of you anyway feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says may god richly bless those who read it d o e s g o d l o v e y o u q what kind of question is that anyone who can read sees signs tracts books and bumper stickers that say god loves you isn t that true a it is true that god offers his love to the whole world as we read in one of the most quoted verses in the bible for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life john however god s love is qualified the bible says the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness proverbs for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish psalm q but i am not wicked i am a decent moral person surely the good i have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad i have done how can these verses apply to me a by god s standard of righteousness even the most moral person is looked upon by god as a desperate sinner on his way to hell the bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to heaven on the contrary we are all sinners and we are all guilty before god as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god romans the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it jeremiah q if i am such a wicked person in god s sight what will god do to me a the bible teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will come under eternal punishment in a place called hell for a fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountains i will heap mischiefs upon them i will spend mine arrows upon them they shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction i will also send the teeth of beasts upon them with the poison of serpents of the dust deuteronomy q oh come on now hell is not real is it surely things are not that bad a indeed hell is very real and things are that bad for the individ ual who does not know the lord jesus christ as savior the bible makes many references to hell indicating that it is both eternal and consists of perpetual suffering and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire revelation so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth matthew when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power thessalonians q that is terrible why would god create a hell a hell is terrible and it exists because god created man to be accountable to god for his actions god s perfect justice demands payment for sin for the wages of sin is death romans for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad corinthians but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment matthew q does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought to life again to be judged and then to be sent to hell a indeed it does that is unless we can find someone to be our substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal damnation for our sins that someone is god himself who came to earth as jesus christ to bear the wrath of god for all who believe in him all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all isaiah but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed isaiah for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures corinthians for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him corinthians q are you saying that if i trust in christ as my substitute who was already punished for my sins then i will not have to worry about hell anymore a yes this is so if i have believed in christ as my savior then it is as if i have already stood before the judgment throne of god christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him john q but what does it mean to believe on him if i agree with all that the bible says about christ as savior then am i saved from going to hell a believing on christ means a whole lot more than agreeing in our minds with the truths of the bible it means that we hang our whole lives on him it means that we entrust every part of our lives to the truths of the bible it means that we turn away from our sins and serve christ as our lord no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye can not serve god and mammon matthew repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord acts q are you saying that there is no other way to escape hell except through jesus what about all the other religions will their followers also go to hell a yes indeed they can not escape the fact that god holds us account able for our sins god demands that we pay for our sins other religions can not provide a substitute to bear the sins of their followers christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and save us neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved acts jesus said i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me john if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness john q now i am desperate i do not want to go to hell what can i do a you must remember that god is the only one who can help you you must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of god as you see your hopeless condition as a sinner cry out to god to save you and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner luke sirs what must i do to be saved and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved acts q but how can i believe on christ if i know so little about him a wonderfully god not only saves us through the lord jesus but he also gives us the faith to believe on him you can pray to god that he will give you faith in jesus christ as your savior for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god ephesians god works particularly through the bible to give us that faith so if you really mean business with god about your salvation you should use every opportunity to hear and study the bible which is the only word of god in this brochure all verses from the bible are within indented paragraphs give heed to them with all your heart so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god romans q but does this mean that i have to surrender everything to god a yes god wants us to come to him in total humility acknowledging our sinfulness and our helplessness trusting totally in him the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise psalm because we are sinners we love our sins therefore we must begin to pray to god for an intense hatred of our sins and if we sincerely desire salvation we will also begin to turn from our sins as god strengthens us we know that our sins are sending us to hell unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities acts q doesn t the bible teach that i must attend church regularly and be baptized will these save me a if possible we should do these things but they will not save us no work of any kind can secure our salvation salvation is god s sovereign gift of grace given according to his mercy and good pleas ure salvation is not of works lest any man should boast ephesians q what else will happen at the end of the world a those who have trusted in jesus as their savior will be transformed into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with christ forever more for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord thessalonians q what will happen to the earth at that time a god will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens and a new earth where christ will reign with his believers forever more but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness peter q does the bible give us any idea of when the end of the earth will come a yes the end will come when christ has saved all whom he plans to save and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come matthew q can we know how close to the end of the world we might be a yes god gives much information in the bible concerning the timing of the history of the world and tells us that while the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved it will not come as a thief for the believers there is much evidence in the bible that the end of the world and the return of christ may be very very close all the time clues in the bible point to this for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape thessalonians surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets amos q but that means judgment day is almost here a yes it does god warned ancient nineveh that he was going to destroy that great city and he gave them forty days warning and jonah began to enter into the city a day s journey and he cried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown jonah q what did the people of nineveh do a from the king on down they humbled themselves before god repented of their sins and cried to god for mercy but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto god yea let them turn every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not jonah q did god hear their prayers a yes god saved a great many people of nineveh q can i still cry to god for mercy so that i will not come into judg ment a yes there is still time to become saved even though that time has become very short how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him hebrews in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us psalm a r e y o u r e a d y t o m e e t g o d a book entitled written by harold camping presents biblical information that we may

radio oakland california the united states of amer ica or call the foregoing is a copy of the does god love you tract printed by and available free of charge from family radio a number of minor changes have been made to its layout to facilitate computer printing and distribution the only change to the text itself is the paragraph which describes the way in which biblical passages appear within the text in the original tract they appear in italic lettering they appear here as indented paragraphs i have read mr camping s book compared it with what the bible actual ly says find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the future holds that i have ever come across and agree with him that there is just too much data to ignore while none of us is guaranteed one more second of life and while we therefore should take these matters very seriously regardless of when christ will actually return it would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal destiny until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless now because in all likelihood the law of averages with respect to life expectancy no longer applies if you wish to obtain a copy of this book so that you can check out these facts for yourself you may find the following information helpful title author harold camping publisher vantage press distributor baker and taylor isbn i have chosen to share this tract with you because i whole heartedly agree with everything it declares and feel that now perhaps more than ever before this information must be made known to paraphrase acts it does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of god i am always willing to discuss the eternal truths of the bible with anyone who is interested as i believe them to be the

"from subject how to prevent kidney stone formation lines nntp posting host vms ocom okstate edu organization osu college of osteopathic medicine i got asked in sci med nutrition about vitamin c and oxalate production toxic kidney stone formation i decided to post my answer here as well because of the recent question about kidney stones not long after i got into sci med i got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation i m going to state it again here but the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take b supplements read on to find out why i have my asbestos suit on now guys vitamin c will form oxalic acid but large doses are needed above grams per day review article nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney stones with particular emphasis on vitamin c int clin nutr rev but glycine also forms oxalic acid d amino acid oxidases for both glycine and vitamin c one of the best ways to drastically reduce this production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin c or glycine but to increase your intake of vitamin b control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in patients with kidney stones int urol nephrol to mg of b each day significasntly decreased the urinary excretion of oxalate over the month treatment program the action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria clin sci patients receiving at least mg b each day showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels for gylcine this effect is due to increased transaminase activity b is required for transaminase activity which makes less glycine available for oxidative deamination d amino acid oxidases for vitamin c the effect is quite different there are different pathways for vitamin c catabolism the pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have to of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid but this is highly variable and the vitamin c review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto grams per day not too much vitamin c gets catabolized to form oxalic acid at very high doses of vitamin c above grams per day more of the extra vitamin c more than conversion can end up as oxalic acid in a very early study on vitamin c and oxalic production proc soc exp biol med intakes of grams per day up to grams per day increased the average oxalic acid excretion from mg per day up to mg per day until grams per day was reached the average excreted was increased by only to mg per day gram dose gram dose gram dose and gram dose grams jumped it to mg over the average excretion before supplementation and grams jumped it to mg over the average before supplementation b is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body there are probably some enzymes that require vitamin b that we don t know about yet vitamin c catabolism is still not completely understood but the speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires b differences in b levels could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin c challenge this is not the preferred route of catabolism increasing your intake of b would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin c supplements since the typical american diet is deficient in b some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium oxalate kidney stones is b deficiency especially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from the gut diets providing to mg of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate urol int if mg was present each day there was a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion here are the high oxalate foods beans coca instant coffee parsley rhubarb spinach and tea contain at least mg grams beet tops carrots celery chocolate cumber grapefruit kale peanuts pepper sweet potatoe contain to mg grams if the threshold is mg per day you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food selection a recent n eng j med article also points out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being absorbed at all if you also increase your intake of b you shouldn t have to worry about kidney stones at all the rda for b is mg per day for males and mg per day for females directly related to protein intake b can be toxic nerve damage if it is consumed in doses of mg or more per day for an extended peroid weeks to months the usda food survey done in had an average intake of mg per day for males and mg per day for females living in the u s coupled with this low intake was a high protein diet which greatly increases the b requirement as well as the presence of some of the different drugs that either block b absorption are metabolic antagonists of b or promote b excretion in the urine common ones are birth control pills alcohol isoniazid penicillamine and corticosteroids i tell my students to supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that increase the b requirement the dose recommended for patients taking birth control pills is mg per day and this should work for most of the other drugs that increase the b requirement this would be on top of your dietary intake of b any patient that has a history of kidney stone formation should be given b supplements one other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your ca mg dietary ratio is magnesium oxalate is much more soluble than is calcium oxalate the magnesium calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of patients with calcium oxalate calculi invest urol effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the crystallization of calcium in urine changes producted by food magnesium interaction j urol review article magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment of renal calcium stones j presse med there are actually about three times as many

is not one of those boy meets girl problem at least not totally like that to me anyway ok i am a year old sophmore at ncsu about years ago my family and i were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented across the street was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me her name in erin well we became friends that week at the beach and have been writing each other for about years there was a period of about years we lost contact but that was a while ago by the way erin lives in kansas and me in nc ok last year in one of her letters she says that she is coming back to nc to see some of her family who are gon na be there so i drove about hours to see her this is where it begins i spent the whole day with erin one of the best days of my life even though we had been writing each other we still had to get used to being in person she has got to be the most incredible woman i ever met she s one year older than me btw i mean no person in the world could ask for a better person not only was she incredibly beautiful not to mention way out of my league although i m not unattractive mind you but she had a great personality and a great sence of humor her family is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the extent of their christianity you know the kind of people but she knows i am a christian well you get the idea of what i think of her if there is ever such a thing as love at first sight i found it that was last year i kid you not when i say that i have thought about her every day since then in out letters erin and i always kid each other about not finding dates which is true for me but i know it can t be for her she has had some problems at home her folks split up and she ended up leaving school now we are at the present let me give you part of the letter i got from her last week okay now i m going to try to explain my life to you i m not going to ku anymore because something just isn t right college just wasn t clicking with me here greek life is really big here and that just isn t my way i wasn t taking any classes that truly interested me i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life i was interested in something medical physical therpy i love working with kids but it just didn t work for me at this university and my parents could tell so i m working full time at the bass store bass shoes that is and now i have a part time job at a local daycare i work in the infant room m w f i ve really enjoyed it so far it spices up my week a little bit and it s great experience as of now i m not planning on going back to school in the very near future the main reason being my indecision on what i want to study but i definatley plan on going back within the next couple of years where i have no idea except for one thing it won t be to kansas right noew i m discussing a promotion with my boss and district manager it looks like i ll train at the store i work at now for about months as assistant manager and when that s done i ll basically be given a list of stores newly or soon to be built to chose where i would like to manage i ve pretty much decided on either one of the carolinas hopeully close to the beach wouldn t it be fun to actually see each other more than once every few years what do you think abou that i would like to know your opinion this job would pretty much be temporary but it is very good pay and any thye of management experience would look good on an application or resume the company is solid and treats it employees very well good benefits bonuses medical plans plus after year of full time service they will reimburse tuition i do have school money waitng for me but this will help especially since i will probably end up paying out of state tuition wherever i go chris i really would like to know what you think of my decision i respect your opinion i ve been completely lost for what to do for soooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really good i do like my job although i m about sure that i want to do more with my life than reatil management but it is something i don t think earning about a year for a year old female is too bad anyway onto your career decisions i ll solve your problem right now marry me you can do your pilot thing i like to be by myself sometimes seriously or not as seriously do what will make you the happiest worry about the home life later ok well i m sure you see what has got me so uptight what do you think she meant about the marraige thing i dream at night about marrying her and then she mentions it in her letter i don t know what to think since she wants to move to the carolina s should i search out a bass store near here and aske her to come to carolina i always pick on those people who graduate from high school and get married but what does she mean i ve had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that i don t date beacause no time not that much that most college women are wrapped up in the social scene with the greeks whic as a christian i can t support and here she says she doesn t like the greek thing either maybe i m so stunned because there is actually a girl that i am so attracted to paying some real attention to me i mean what if she did move to nc what would i do i m only and she i m only a sophmore struggling through classes i have prayed about this over the past year from time to time saying god if she is the right one let the situation open up could this be my sign i would do anything to get her to nc here is some moree that makes it worse should i call her i m terrible over the phone i don t even like to talk to my friends here for longer than minutes i mean what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very average guy like me i m really confused i would really

"from leonard newnham subject re islam and scientific predictions was organization university of bradford uk lines x newsreader tin version pl umar khan wrote i strongly suggest that you look up a book called the bible the quran and science by maurice baucaille a french surgeon it is not comprehensive he was unable to find a wealth of scientific statements in the holy qur an but what he did find made sense with modern understanding so he investigated the traditions the hadith to see what they had to say about science they were filled with science problems after all they were contemporary narratives from a time which had by pour standards a primitive world view his conclusion was that while he was impressed that what little the holy qur an had to say about science was accurate he was far more impressed that the holy qur an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in the traditions how would a man of th century arabia have known what not to include in the holy qur an assuming he had authored it this book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue the book is in two sections section contains a fairly reasonable analysis of the bible showing many inconsistencies between the bible and modern science well we all know that no surprises section analyses the koran s version of the old testament stories and seems on the face of it to present a good case showing the koran is consistent with modern science however it was plain to me that this consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the koran take the flood for example the bible is full of detail forty days and forty nights pair of every animal etc we all know this is nonsense the koran s description of the same event is so obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as a big river flooded for a few days and caused much damage yes no contradiction but also not much fact the koran might be consistent with modern science but being consistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that time does not seem much of an achievement the book concludes by saying something like the koran must have had divine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot of to us now ridiculous ideas about the universe and none of them can be found in the koran arguing for the greatness of a book by talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme the above is of course from memory so i may have missed some points leonard e mail",869

through the moderators quote screens so i did violence to it but if you remember the article i am responding to it should still make sence in article james sledd writes hi xian netters god bless you what no hello for heathan netters i feel all left out now deletia table of content intro homosexuality incredibly chopped up post deletia incorrect attributions uh you have your attributions wrong you were responding to my article so dan johnson should be the st one in article jayne kulikauskas writes deletia no free gifts speil nuked by moderator fiat i find that i am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can manufacture for ourselves little in the cosmic sense ah in the _cosmic_ sence but who lives in the cosmic sence not me cosmicly we don t even exist for all practical purposes i can hardly use the cosmic sence of stuff as a guide to life it would just say don t bother luckily for mortals there are many sences of scale you can talk about in a human sence you can have big purposes even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind eventually to be turned into dust but the influence of aristotle confucious alexander ceasar and countless others is still with us although their works have perished but they have changed to course of history and while humanity exists their deeds can not be said to have come to nothing even if they are utterly forgotten mankind itself will one day perish one day surely well unless you believe in the second coming which i do not but in that time we can make a difference without some interconnectedness that transcends the physical without god it is all pointless in the end in the end but it must be the end until then there is all the point you can muster and when that end comes there will be nobody to ask gee i don t think james sledd s deeds are gon na make much of a difference ulitmately ya know but they will have already have made a difference great or small before the end why must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile most people are able to live with that and for them little purposes success money power effecting change helping others suffice little is in the eye of the beholder of course i suppose they never think about the cosmic scale or are at least able to put it out of their minds i don t doubt it but i have thought about the cosmic scale and it does not seem to mean much to us here today to me it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion i would not find this comforting but perhaps it is merely my definitions here s what i think the relevant terms are reality that which is real illusion that which is not real but seems to be real objectively existing for reality to be an illusion would mean then that which is real is not real but seems to be or that which objectively exists does not objectively exist but does seem to objectively exist from which we can conclude that unless you want to get a contradiction that no things objectively exist but i have a problem with this because i would like to say that i objectively exist if nothing else cogito ergo sum and all that perhaps you do not mean all that but rather mean objective reality is unreachable by humans which is not so bad and so far as i know is true that the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit have on if reality is an illusion isn t true reality an illusion too and if true reality is spirit doens t that make spirit an illusion as well if i am not distinctly confused this is getting positively buddhist that this world is a school of sorts where we learn and grow and our souls mature that is one hell of a statement although perhaps true do you mean to imply that it was intended to be so if so please show that this is true if not please explain how this can give a purpose to anything that gives a purpose to my little purposes how does it do that wouldn t the world school w intent idea make the world a preparation for some greater purpose rather than a purpose in itself and takes some of the pressure off what pressure it s not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if you re really just here to learn it is not necessary to be a success in human terms unless your goals either include doing so or require doing so before they themselves can be achived indeed many people have set goals for themselves that do not include success in human terms as _i_ understand it check out yer buddhist monk type guy out for nirvana which is not at all the same thing it s more important to progress grow persist to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love especially when it s dificult to do so honest effort is rewarded by god he knows our limitations why is learning to love a goal what happens if you fail in this goal to you to god to the mysterious purpose deletia question about immortailty and my answer deleted because it was mostly quote two serious questions invitations to discussion what is the nature of eternal life how can we as mortals locked into space time conceive of it possible answer for the best we can do is metaphor analogy question a what is the best metaphor i ll have a crack at that the nature of eternal life is neatly described by its name it is the concept of life without death life without end no we can put together word to describe it but we can not imagine it a no metaphor is adequate next to eternity if it were we could not understand it either or so i suspect dan johnson and god said jeeze this is dull and it was dull genesis these opinions probably show

internet mail tel direct fax changes in this version added information on stressfree another typing management tool for windows typing management tools these aim to help you manage your keyboard use by warning you to take a break every so often the better ones also include advice on exercises posture and workstation setup some use sound hardware to warn of a break others use beeps or screen messages often rsi appears only after many years of typing and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening these tools act as an early warning system by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises you don t have to wait for your body to give you a more serious and painful warning that is getting rsi tool at your service commercial software available from bright star tel platforms mac system windows description provides calendar keyboard watch email watch and system

program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval based on clock time or after a set number of keystrokes whichever is earlier it gives you exercises to do each time randomly selected from a set of exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work you do data entry word processing information processing exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does chb includes hypertext information on rsi that you can use to learn more about rsi and how to prevent it other information on non rsi topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer a full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included chb can be run in a dos box under windows but does not then warn you when to take a break it does not therefore appear useful when used with windows cost quantity discounts site licenses comments the keystroke counting approach looks good it seems better to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to measure clock time or even typing time the marketing stuff is very good and includes some summaries of research papers as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company to

ergonomic setup for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to promote healthy and efficient computer use cost including shipping and handling quantity discounts for resellers free demo outside us comments i have a copy of this and it works as advertised i would say it is better for rsi prevention than rsi management because it does not allow breaks at periods less than minutes also it interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time which is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day worked ok on windows though it did occasionally crash with a uae not sure why also refused to work with the space bar on one pc and has one window without window controls very usable though and does not require any sound hardware tool lifeguard commercial software

if you do get the demo post it on your local bulletin boards ftp servers and bitnet servers does not include general info on rsi and ergonomics but it does have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises tool typewatch freeware version october available from email to anonymous ftp soda berkeley edu pub typing injury typewatch shar platforms unix tested on sco sunos mach character and x window mode description this is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you to stop typing based on how long you have been continuously typing it does not provide exercises but it does check that you really do take a break and tells you when you can start typing again typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing today each time it warns you which is useful so you know how much you really type it also logs information to a file that you can analyse or simply print out the warning message appears on your screen in character mode in a pop up window for x windows or as a zephyr message for those with athena stuff tim freeman has put in a lot of bug fixes extra features and support for x zephyr and mach not formally supported but email for sco sunos character mode or for mach x window mode zephyr if you have problems or want to give feedback tool various calendar batch queue programs available from various sources platforms various description any calendar reminder program that warns you of an upcoming appointment can be turned into an ad hoc rsi management tool or any batch queue submission program that lets you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen using windows as an example create a calendar file and include this filename in your win ini s load line so you get it on every startup of windows suppose you want to have breaks every minutes starting from am press f special time to enter an appointment enter hit enter and type some text in saying what the break is for then press f to set an alarm on this entry and repeat for the next appointment by using windows recorder you can record the keystrokes that set up breaks throughout a day in a rec file put this file on your run line as above and you will then with a single keypress be able to set up your daily appointments with rsi exercises the above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs an example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job that runs at am and warns you to take a break this will depend a lot on your operating system while these approaches are not ideal they are a good way of forcing yourself to take a break if you can t get hold of a suitable rsi management tool if you are techie enough you might want to write a version of typewatch see above for your operating system using batch jobs or whatever fits best tool digital watches with count down timers available from various sources e g casio bp description many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable number of minutes they usually reset easily to that number either manually or automatically while these are a very basic tool they are very useful if you are writing reading driving or doing anything away from a computer which can still cause or aggravate rsi the great advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you are doing comments my own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to my writing a lot more and still reading as much as ever which actually aggravated the rsi in my right arm though the left arm improved getting a count down timer watch has been very useful on some occasions where i write a lot in a day i have tried an old fashioned hour glass type egg timer but these are not much good because they do not give an audible warning of the end of the time period keyboard remapping tools these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one handedly or with a different two handed layout one handed typing tools may help but be very careful about how you use them if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing and may therefore make matters worse tool hsh public domain available from anonymous ftp soda berkeley edu pub typing injury hsh shar platforms unix don t know which ones description allows one handed

"from marida ignacio subject refusing divine peace and alive prayer was re question about mary organization trunking_fixed lines it s like refusing god s kingdom come in one of jesus revelation in this century same thing as in the old days people refuse to believe my messengers even when i was alive here on earth they refuse me what more when i am just talking through somebody else paraphrased with all the knowledge believers accumulated he would think that we would be enlightened enough to detect which ones are authentic and divine as opposed to evil or man made these signs these miracles are you afraid that they are not from god that these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking they are evil well is faith in god evil is true peace evil is true love that is divine and pure evil why can t someone accept that god can do what he wants in fulfillment of his generous love and jesus never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to him for salvation why are we refusing god s messenger of this truth the mother to all who are in christ what brings us these fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us which in contrary could be pleasing to god fears of being humbled fears of being judged as wrong wrt mainstream standard of what is right why can t we tolerate non believers mockery or ridicule of us for the sake of peace love and obedience to god the humbling lessons left to us by martyrs and saints we d rather engage in never ending bickering and disproof of each other s opinion looking at each other s mistakes for the sake of arguments instead of having communion in one body with christ what makes us go blind to the truth that god is all powerful and that he can not be binded by what people wrote and have written about him in all ages why is our faith in god limited by all the words and literature we muster what prevents us from going beyond being saved and extend god s rich love to others who are not why are our eyes not wide open to see that he continuously sees our faith hope and love which glorify him and so he gives us indications of his acknowledgements with signs miracles ordinary common or divinely inspired everywhere isn t that like an atheist agnostic s view that all these are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural why then does the holy mother comes back to remind us we must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that with prayers __even wars can be prevented__ but then she continues you often have an egotistic attitude dear children in these days you have prayed very much __but your hands have remained empty__ why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done prayer conversion peace penance fasting the holy mass living life as what the gospel brings why not do so how to the world to this the mother says start in your family be a good example live the word why worry if it is going to be of good use to many our holy mother says the fruits __leave them to the lord__ do not worry about anything or anyone but entrust yourself to the lord although the holy mother does not insist because you are free i bow before the freedom which god gives you but she follows this with you are surprised because i say to you decide for god and yet see how you have lived this day why does she constantly conveys take this life toward god in the way as to __experience__ the lord himself in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray or one time when we decide that we are saved or talk write about god etc the holy mother warns satan the serpent is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from my peace plan and prayer rev the dragon became angry with the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings those who keep god s commandments and bear witness to jesus do you have fear or hate for god s current messenger of true peace love and our motherly protector from the anti christ the one who is being apprehensive of communism wars famine and other evils that the serpent brings upon us this obedient and blessed new eve the mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against satan haven t there been renewed faith hope love peace and obedience wherever this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that god has given her in good purpose why do we choose to be blind why fear the truth that god has been giving us a chance and sharing christ s ever forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother the mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient harm and example done by the ancient eve she has been preparing the new eden with her immaculate heart the new eden as sanctuary the womb for the next coming and judgement of the righteous by our lord jesus christ when the lamb marries his bride shouldn t we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the second coming of her son as she has been conceived without sin to bear the son of god in her womb why fear true peace love and renewed faith and obedience to god that mary faithfully brings to god s children she has been protecting the flock the rest of the offsprings from the greedy dragon so as to present more righteous members for her son s coming not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy of belief with prayer and guidance from the holy spirit and of course approval of our church authorities we should be aware of the true and divinely inspired ones specifically the ones which aligns with the scripture also our lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers if you speak unceasingly in your prayers how will you be able to hear god allow him room to answer you to speak to you she encourages us with motherly nurturing to continue in exuberant faith hope and love to jesus constantly not with mere emotions but with deep constant obedience to jesus her beloved son and acknowledgement of our need to have him as part of our lives let s not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that god wants us to live when there won t be enough time or when it will be late nowadays mary says pray pray pray for peace reconciliation my children have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others for without peace you can not fully accept my son and you think she s just an ordinary lady not to me she s our good mother messenger from god and she is so nice enough to share god s kingdom to us through her son and experience it with mary we are assured that the lamb always succeeds note all enclosed in quotes are from latest news of medjugorje number june by fr rene laurentin o new mother of eden most pure preparing the sanctuary for true christians cleansing us

"from petri pihko subject re atheist s views on christianity was re accepting jeesus in your heart organization university of oulu finland lines first i thank collectively all people who have given good answers to my questions in my follow up to jason smith s posting i will address some issues that have caused misunderstanding jason smith wrote in article petri pihko writes i also concede that i was doubly remiss as i asserted no reasonable alternative exists an entirely subjective statement on my part and one that could be invalidated given time and further discovery by the scientist i also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily specify that this is how it happened but proposes a likely description of the phenomena in question am i mistaken with this understanding yes to some degree there was an excellent discussion in sci skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago i hope it did not escape your notice the correct word is likely there is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct theories are backed up by evidence but not proved no theory can be true in a mathematical sense however theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena it is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed all successful theories science has come up with have passed this test including the big bang theory of cosmic evolution the theory of natural selection etc it does not mean they _must_ be correct but they are not mere best fits for the data but if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the universe our spacetime emerge from nothing science has some good candidates for an answer all of which require something we christians readily admit to faith well yes if you want to _believe_ in them this is not what science requires take a good look at the theory and the evidence see if the theory has made any successful predictions and use your reason disbelievers are not punished the fact that there are several candidates belies that none are conclusive with out conclusive evidence we are left with faith this is what puzzles me why do we need to have faith in _anything_ my fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist someone who is unable to believe ie fails to entertain any belief in god yes i know that one can t believe without god s help luther makes this quite clear in his letter to erasmus i m afraid this does not change my situation a couple of paragraphs deleted summary we ask why does the universe exist i think this question should actually be split into two parts namely why is there existence why anything exists and how did the universe emerge from nothing deletions the question why anything exists can be countered by demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in nothingness or in non existence actually both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning things that exist do and things that don t exist don t exist tautology at its best carefully examine the original question and then the counter question the first asks why while the second is a request for definition no it is not although it does look like one this is a true dichotomy either something exists or nothing exists if nothing exists nobody would ask why if something exists it is possible to ask why but actually no existing being could give an answer imagine for a moment that the nobodies in non existence could also ask why nothing exists this is equivalent to my counter question why nothing exists in nothingness now why anything exists is equivalent to why something exists in somethingness _this_ is what i meant with my tautology my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post i might add the worldview of things that exist do and things that don t don t is as grounded in the realm of the non falsifiable as does the theist s belief in god it is based on the assumption that there is not a reason for being something as ultimately un supportable as the position of there being a reason its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there is a reason i do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being or existence in general for reasons i stated above however they will still leave open the question why this and not that and this is where theistic explanations come in science can not give reasons for any _particular_ human being s existence we come to this either i am therefore i am or i am for a reason this is a deep philosophical question is determinism true or not also is god deterministic or not i tend to think this question has no meaning in his case if i am for a reason i ve yet failed to see what it would be from our perspective it looks like i exist for truly random reasons i just rolled two dice why did i get and how can i believe there is any better reason for my existence if the former is a satisfactory answer then you are done for you are satisfied and need not a doctor if the latter your search is just beginning yes i am satisfied with this reason until i find something better my years of christianity were of no help in this respect i have to admit but i am patient another answer is that god is the _source_ of all existence this sounds much better but i am tempted to ask does god himself exist then if god is the source of his own existence it can only mean that he has in terms of human time always existed but this is not the same as the source of all existence this does not preclude his existence it only seeks to identify his qualities implying he exists to have qualities btw no it doesn t but i think an existing god can not know why he exists for an answer to this question is not knowable of course this should not be any obstacle to belief in his existence i also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer why it appears that m pihko agrees as we shall see but because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question asserting that why is an invalid question does not provide an answer it is impossible to know unknowable things however the question why do i exist in particular is _not_ an invalid question this is not what i said but from our perspective it is impossible to tell and i can t just believe in any given explanation instead of another especially since i found i was deluding myself my apologies i was using why as why did this come to be why did pre existence become existence why did pre spacetime become spacetime i think pre existence is an oxymoron there is no time outside of this spacetime except in some other universe and from that perspective our universe never was it exists only for those who are inside it but we come to the admission that science fails to answer why because it can t be answered in the realm of modern science does that make the question invalid no the validity of the question has to be discussed separately i think philosophy is of great help here what can be known and what is not knowable m pihko does present a good point though we may need to ask what do i as an individual christian base my faith on will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our sacred cows or will we seek to understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what god said and continues to say in his word this is a very good question in trying to answer this and numerous other questions that bothered me i finally found nothing to base my faith on i think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves why do i believe or why i don t

"from paul harvey subject re sabbath admissions of organization the duck pond public unix log in as guest lines i wrote in response to darius_lecointe it s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq i think paul s comments on esteeming one day over another rom is probably all that needs to be said was paul a god too is an interpretation of the words of paul of higher priority than the direct word of jesus in matt paul begins romans with if someone is weak in the faith do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith i accept that darius is doing what he does in honor of the lord i just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing their best to honor the lord yes but what does the bible have to say what did jesus say paul closes romans with on the other hand the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty because he isn t acting on his faith and any failure to act on faith is a sin gaus isbn have you read the ten commandments which are a portion of the law have you read jesus word in matt is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is sin greek hamartia missing the mark however i d like to be clear that i do not think there s unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day as i indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited whereas the ten commandments and jesus words in matt are fairly clear are they not the difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else they both look like they are talking about nnregular christian meetings but neither explicitly says and they gathered every sunday for worship we get various pieces of information but nothing aimed at answering this question matt doesn t answer your question what day christians met in their houses acts despite darius confusion is described by acts as occuring on sunday it doesn t say they gathered to see paul off but that when they were gathered for breaking bread breaking bread roughly synonymous with eating so i think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day of every week simply means every time they gather for worship how do you unite this concept of yours with the ten commandments and jesus s word in matt i think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christian worship was clh or they assumed that the ten commandments and jesus word in matt actually stood for something perhaps they were strong in the faith no i don t believe that paul can overrule god however paul was writing for a largely gentile audience the law was regarded by jews at the time and now as binding on jews but not on gentiles there are rules that were binding on all human beings the so called noachic laws but they are quite minimal the issue that the church had to face after jesus death was what to do about gentiles who wanted to follow christ the decision not to impose the law on them didn t say that the law was abolished it simply acknowledged that fact that it didn t apply to gentiles thus there is no contradiction with mat as far as i can tell both paul and other jewish christians did continue to participate in jewish worship on the sabbath thus they continued to obey the law the issue was and is with gentile christians who are not covered by the law or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it jesus dealt mostly with jews i think we can reasonably assume that mat was directed to a jewish audience he did interact with gentiles a few times e g the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others the terms used to describe the centurion see luke suggest that he was a god fearer i e a gentile who followed god but had not adopted the whole jewish law he was commended by jewish elders as a worthy person and jesus accepted him as such this seems to me to indicate that jesus accepted the prevailing view that gentiles need not accept the law however there s more involved if you want to compare jesus and paul on the law in order to get a full picture of the role of the law we have to come to grips with paul s apparent rejection of the law and how that relates to jesus commendation of the law at least as i read paul he says that the law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded again this issue isn t one of the abolition of the law in the middle of his discussion paul notes that he might be understood this way and assures us that that s not what he intends to say rather he sees the law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness but ultimately it s an impossible standard and one that has been superceded by christ paul s comments are not the world s clearest here and not everyone agrees with my reading but the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the law it still remains as an uncompromising standard from which not an iota or dot may be removed for its purpose of convicting of sin it s important that it not be relaxed however for christians it s not the end ultimately we live in faith not law while the theoretical categories they use are rather different in the end i think jesus and paul come to a rather similar conclusion the quoted passage from mat should be taken in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount where jesus shows us how he interprets the law the not an iota or dot would suggest a rather literal reading but in fact that s not jesus approach jesus interpretations emphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonial details indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the sabbath and kosher laws some scholars claim that mat needs to be taken in the context of st cent jewish discussions jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs but neglecting the things that really matter justice mercy and faith and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity mat this and the discussion later in mat suggest that jesus has a very specific view of the law in mind and that when he talks about maintaining the law in its full strength he is thinking of these aspects of it paul s conclusion is similar while he talks about the law being superceded all of the specific examples he gives involve the ceremonial law such as circumcision and the sabbath he is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards the net result of this is that when paul talks about the law being superceded and jesus talks about the law being maintained i believe they are talking about different aspects of the law paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision as is natural in letters responding to specific situations he s looking at the aspect of the law that is currently causing trouble the law as specifically jewish ceremonies he certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct on the other hand when jesus commends the law he seems to be talking the law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give paul so much trouble it s unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts look at the way terms like family values take on special meaning from the current context imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why family values should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the u s i think law had taken on a similar role in the arguments paul was involved in paul was clearly not rejecting all of the jewish values that go along with the term law any more than people who concerned about the family values movement are really opposed to family values clh",951

"from subject re death penalty gulf war long lines in article mathew writes writes in article mathew writes which liberal news media are we talking about western news in general but in particular the american mass media cbs nbc abc etc the general tone of the news during the whole war was one of those poor poor iraqis along with look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits most odd over here there was very little about the suffering of the iraqi civilians until towards the end of the war and then it was confined to the few remaining quality newspapers true at first the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets but later and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit they changed their tone it seemed to me that they didn t have the stomach for the reality of war that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare it s like they were only pro gulf war as long as it was nice and clean smart missiles dropping in on military hqs but not when pictures of dead dying and maimed civilians started cropping up what naive hypocrites how about all the innocent people who died in blanket bombing in ww i don t hear you bemoaning them discussion about blanket bombing and a bombs deleted all things considered the fire bombings and the atomic bomb were essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied losses i should have said here militarily justified it seems from your comments below that you understood this as meaning morally justified i apologize what about the evidence that america knew japan was about to surrender after hiroshima but before nagasaki is that another lie peddled by the liberal media conspiracy i have often wondered about this i ve always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on japan s island fortress of truk a good inpenatrable military target the second bomb could ve been held back for use on an industrial center if need be but i digress yes i have heard that we found evidence after the war btw that japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb unfortunately the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the us s ulimatum therefore the second bomb was dropped most unfortunate imo i for one don t regret it nuke a jap for jesus i don t regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people but i do regret the circumstances which make those decisions necessary and i regret the suffering caused by those decisions why all the fuss about kuwait and not east timor bosnia or even tibet if iraq is so bad why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks before we started bombing i make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the west before the war it is evident that the west especially america misjudged hussein drastically but once hussein invaded kuwait and threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world s oil supply he had to be stopped oh i see so we can overlook his using chemical weapons on thousands of people but if he threatens your right to drive a huge gas guzzling car well the man s got ta go actually it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted us and allied action if some back water country took over some other back water country we probably wouldn t intervene not that we don t care but we can t be the world s policman or if a coup had occured in kuwait instead of an invasion then we still wouldn t have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to saudi arabia but the combination of the two an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the west s oil interests caused us to take action i ve moved a paragraph from here to later on if we hadn t intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeasement right but did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action or are you just setting up a strawman i m not setting up a strawman at all if you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keep kuwait diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective i guess we shouldn t have fought ww either just think of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg yes do germans are human too you know sure what was truly unfortunate was that they followed hitler in his grandiose quest for a thousand year reich the consequences stemmed from that translation they were asking for it well in a sense yes they probably had no idea of what end hitler would lead their nation to but what about those who didn t support hitler s dreams of conquest it s not as if they democratically voted for all his policies the nsdap got in the elections of and that was the last chance the german people got to vote on the matter they suffered along with the rest why does this bother you so much the world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others it it regretable but that s the way it is there are no perfect solutions i look forward to hearing your incisive comments about east timor and tibet what should i say about them anything in particular the people of east timor are still being killed by a dictatorship that invaded their country hell even western journalists have been killed all this was happening before the gulf war why didn t we send in the bombers to east timor why aren t we sending in the bombers now probably because we re not the saviors of the world we can t police each and every country that decides to self destruct or invade another nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor or some other places here s that paragraph i moved what s your intent to sound like a loving christian well you aren t doing a very good job of it well it s not very loving to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion so i d have to say yes stopping hussein was the most loving thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest the chinese government has a policy of mandatory abortion and sterilization of tibetans tibetan people are rounded up tortured and executed amnesty international recently reported that torture is still widespread in china why aren t we stopping them in fact why are we actively sucking up to them by trading freely with them tell me how we could stop them and i ll support it i for one do not agree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put it i agree that it is deplorable and as for poor poor rodney king did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty yes amongst the things i thought were hmm there s an awful lot of white people in that jury so it was the policemen on trial not rodney king erm surely it s irrelevant who s on trial juries are supposed to represent a cross section of the population are they or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale where the trial is held normally this is where the crime is committed unless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue is in order i m not an expert on california law or even us law but it seems that this is the way the system is set up you can criticize the system but let s not have unfounded allegations of racial prejudice thrown around and under american law they deserved a jury of their peers you are saying that black people are not the peers of white people no not at all the point is that the fact that there were no blacks on the first jury and that rodney king is black is totally irrelevant this point of allegedly racial motivations is really shallow this idea of people only being tried before a jury of people just like them is really stupid should the nuremburg trials have had a jury entirely made up of nazis germans perhaps peers doesn t mean those who do the same thing like having murderers judge murderers it means having people from the same station in life presumably because they are in a better position to understand the defendent s motivation s those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i have not seen when i see a bunch of policemen beating someone who s lying defenceless on the ground it s rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have been so it s hard to imagine so when has argument from incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of constructing a logical argument we re not talking about a logical argument we re talking about a court of law as the faq points out some fallacious arguments are not viewed as fallacies in a court of law ok granted however you are using this reasoning as part of your logical argument in this discussion this is not a court of law if the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then i feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable one were you not talking earlier about the bias of the liberal media conspiracy the media is not totally monolithic even though there is a prevailing liberal bias programs such as the macneil lehrer news hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news there are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look hurrah for rush btw i never used the word conspiracy i don t accept without far more evidence theories that there is some all pervading liberal conspiracy attempting to take over all news sources thou shalt not kill unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who gets in the way as unfortunately it can not be helped jim brown bible for loving christians thanks mathew i like the quote pretty funny actually i m a monty python fan you know kind of seems in that vein of course oversimplifying any moral argument can make it seem contradictory but then you know that already ha ha only serious i an atheist am arguing against killing innocent people you a supposed christian are arguing that it s ok to kill innocent people so long as you get some guilty ones as well hardly i didn t say that it s a good thing tm to kill innocent people if the end is just unfortunately we don t live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions if one is going to resist tyranny then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die i didn t say it is ok it is unfortunate but sometimes necessary i a moral relativist am arguing that saturation bombing of german cities at the end of world war ii was as far as i can see an evil and unnecessary act i would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering i m not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say that conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved and perhaps it was unnecessary as let s say we now know that doesn t mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn t see it as being necessary rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision at the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it but don t assume that i feel the bombing was morally justified i don t i just don t condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances you having criticised moral relativism in the past are now arguing that i am in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the war you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist i as an absolutist am in a position to judge but i defer judgment you are arguing that the actions need to be assessed in the particular context of the time and that they might have been moral then but not moral now wrong they were neither moral then nor now they seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war i simply refuse to condemn them for their decision where s your christian love where s your absolute morality oh how quick you are to discard them when it suits you as ivan stang would say jesus would puke one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this forum i understand the full ramifications of that and i am prepared to do so i don t believe that you can make the same claim mathew and btw the reason i brought up the blanket bombing in germany was because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being so deplorable yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn t accurate enough to hit industrial military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time but in the gulf war precision bombing was the norm so the point was why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilians proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing in ww even with precision bombing mistakes happen and some civilians suffer but less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history many iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids the stories of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk yes bunk the us lost servicemen in ww over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting but we are expected to swallow that hundreds of thousands of civilian iraqis died in a war lasting about months and with the allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that what hogwash if hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilians died it was due to actions hussein took on his own people not due to the allied bombing regards jim b",965

"from mathew subject alt atheism faq introduction to atheism summary please read this file before posting to alt atheism keywords faq atheism expires thu may gmt distribution world organization mantis consultants cambridge uk supersedes lines archive name atheism introduction alt atheism archive name introduction last modified april version begin pgp signed message an introduction to atheism by mathew this article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism whilst i have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint i would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions some relevant books are listed in a companion article to provide a sense of cohesion and progression i have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist all the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt atheism since the newsgroup was created some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a christian viewpoint this is because the faq files reflect questions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly christians who proselytize on alt atheism so when i talk of religion i am talking primarily about religions such as christianity judaism and islam which involve some sort of superhuman divine being much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of it may not what is atheism atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of god some atheists go further and believe that god does not exist the former is often referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strong atheism it is important to note the difference between these two positions weak atheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god strong atheism is a positive belief that god does not exist please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists some atheists believe in the non existence of all gods others limit their atheism to specific gods such as the christian god rather than making flat out denials but isn t disbelieving in god the same thing as believing he doesn t exist definitely not disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not which brings us to agnosticism what is agnosticism then the term agnosticism was coined by professor huxley at a meeting of the metaphysical society in he defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and can not know for sure whether god exists words are slippery things and language is inexact beware of assuming that you can work out someone s philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic for example many people use agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only when referring to strong atheism beware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning it is very difficult to generalize about atheists about all you can say for sure is that atheists don t believe in god for example it certainly isn t the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe so what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism there are many philosophical justifications for atheism to find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist it s best to ask her many atheists feel that the idea of god as presented by the major religions is essentially self contradictory and that it is logically impossible that such a god could exist others are atheists through scepticism because they see no evidence that god exists but isn t it impossible to prove the non existence of something there are many counter examples to such a statement for example it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers of course this deals with well defined objects obeying well defined rules whether gods or universes are similarly well defined is a matter for debate however assuming for the moment that the existence of a god is not provably impossible there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non existence of god if we assume that something does not exist it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter example if on the other hand we assume that something does exist and if the thing in question is not provably impossible showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found to show that it isn t there such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible there is no such problem with largest primes because we can prove that they don t exist therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do even theists follow this rule most of the time they don t believe in unicorns even though they can t conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere to assume that god exists is to make an assumption which probably can not be tested we can not make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be to prove that he doesn t exist anywhere so the sceptical atheist assumes by default that god does not exist since that is an assumption we can test those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of god exists instead they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of god described by followers of various religions so whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exists it may be possible to prove that say a god as described by a particular religious book does not exist it may even be possible to prove that no god described by any present day religion exists in practice believing that no god described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no god exists however it is sufficiently different that counter arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of god are not really applicable but what if god is essentially non detectable if god interacts with our universe in any way the effects of his interaction must be measurable hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable if god is essentially non detectable it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way many atheists would argue that if god does not interact with our universe at all it is of no importance whether he exists or not if the bible is to be believed god was easily detectable by the israelites surely he should still be detectable today note that i am not demanding that god interact in a scientifically verifiable physical way it must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence though otherwise how can i distinguish him from all the other things that don t exist ok you may think there s a philosophical justification for atheism but isn t it still a religious belief one of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is the redefinition game the cynical view of this game is as follows person a begins by making a contentious statement when person b points out that it can t be true person a gradually re defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person b is prepared to accept he then records the statement along with the fact that person b has agreed to it and continues eventually a uses the statement as an agreed fact but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get b to agree to it rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent b will tend to play along the point of this digression is that the answer to the question isn t atheism a religious belief depends crucially upon what is meant by religious religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power especially in some sort of god and by faith and worship it s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of buddhism are not religion according to such a definition atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense widening the definition of religious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well such as science politics and watching tv ok so it s not a religion but surely belief in atheism or science is still just an act of faith like religion is firstly it s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in secondly it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt science has a number of core assumptions for example it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers these are the sort of core assumptions atheists make if such basic ideas are called acts of faith then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith and the term loses its meaning faith is more often used to refer to complete certain belief in something according to such a definition atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith of course individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is certain this is not a general tendency however there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof sceptical atheism certainly doesn t fit that definition as sceptical atheism has no beliefs strong atheism is closer but still doesn t really match as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data or the lack of it when asserting that god does not exist if atheism is not religious surely it s anti religious it is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for or against friend or enemy the truth is not so clear cut atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism in that sense it can be said to be anti religion however when religious believers speak of atheists being anti religious they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists this categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum most atheists take a live and let live attitude unless questioned they will not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friends of course this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable in many countries a few atheists are quite anti religious and may even try to convert others when possible historically such anti religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the eastern bloc countries to digress slightly the soviet union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state just like the usa soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished the institution of state atheism came about when stalin took control of the soviet union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business for example the government of the usa such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate but if you don t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state surely that s the same as state atheism the principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief in particular it means not only that the state can not promote one religion at the expense of another but also that it can not promote any belief which is religious in nature religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters for example religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms even today many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns so long as they campaign concerning secular matters and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say what about prayer in schools if there s no god why do you care if people pray because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers and tend to do things that those who don t pray can t just ignore also christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non christians even if they are told that they need not join in the diversity of religious and non religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event also non prayers tend to have friends and family who pray it is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time even without other motives you mentioned christians who campaign for increased foreign aid what about atheists why aren t there any atheist charities or hospitals don t atheists object to the religious charities there are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to some atheists contribute to religious charities as well for the sake of the practical good they do some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn t worth shouting about in connection with charity to them atheism is just a simple obvious everyday matter and so is charity many feel that it s somewhat cheap not to say self righteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs to weak atheists building a hospital to say i do not believe in god is a rather strange idea it s rather like holding a party to say today is not my birthday why the fuss atheism is rarely evangelical you said atheism isn t anti religious but is it perhaps a backlash against one s upbringing a way of rebelling perhaps it is for some but many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious or atheist ideas upon them and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists it s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing as a way of being different on the other hand many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others on the whole we can t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism although in general people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently how do atheists differ from religious people they don t believe in god that s all there is to it atheists may listen to heavy metal backwards even or they may prefer a verdi requiem even if they know the words they may wear hawaiian shirts they may dress all in black they may even wear orange robes many buddhists lack a belief in any sort of god some atheists even carry a copy of the bible around for arguing against of course whoever you are the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance unexceptional but aren t atheists less moral than religious people that depends if you define morality as obedience to god then of course atheists are less moral as they don t obey any god but usually when one talks of morality one talks of what is acceptable right and unacceptable wrong behaviour within society humans are social animals and to be maximally successful they must co operate with each other this is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from anti social or immoral behaviour purely for the purposes of self preservation many atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans so why do they care what happens to others they don t know they simply are that way naturally there are some people who behave immorally and try to use atheism to justify their actions however there are equally many people who behave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions for example here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance jesus christ came into the world to save sinners but for that very reason i was shown mercy so that in me jesus christ might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and ever the above quote is from a statement made to the court on february th by jeffrey dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of milwaukee wisconsin it seems that for every atheist mass murderer there is a religious mass murderer but what of more trivial morality a survey conducted by the roper organization found that behavior deteriorated after born again experiences while only of respondents said they had driven intoxicated before being born again had done so after conversion similarly had used illegal drugs before conversion after two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex before salvation after freethought today september p so it seems that at best religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour is there such a thing as atheist morality if you mean is there such a thing as morality for atheists then the answer is yes as explained above many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people if you mean does atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answer is no atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theists but for different reasons atheists view morality as something created by humans according to the way humans feel the world ought to work rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being then aren t atheists just theists who are denying god a study by the freedom from religion foundation found that over of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them they had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial they are unbelievers through choice the vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions sometimes in very great depth they have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs this decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of that individual s personality for a naturally sceptical person the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense and hence the only choice that person can honestly make but don t atheists want to believe in god atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them many of them have no desire to be watched over no matter how good natured the big brother figure might be some atheists would like to be able to believe in god but so what should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true the risks of such an approach should be obvious atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough there must be evidence for the belief but of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of god they are unwilling in their souls to see many if not most atheists were previously religious as has been explained above the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that god exists many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach god of course it is true that some atheists lack an open mind but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed minded comments such as of course god is there you just aren t looking properly are likely to be viewed as patronizing certainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for god if you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth debate is futile isn t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist many atheists live a purposeful life they decide what they think gives meaning to life and they pursue those goals they try to make their lives count not by wishing for eternal life but by having an influence on other people who will live on for example an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform in the hope of leaving his mark on history it is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in random events however it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thing that has a meaning to put it another way not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask some atheists believe that asking what is the meaning of life is as silly as asking what is the meaning of a cup of coffee they believe that life has no purpose or meaning it just is so how do atheists find comfort in time of danger there are many ways of obtaining comfort from family friends or even pets or on a less spiritual level from food or drink or tv that may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but so what should individuals believe in things because they are comforting or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be in the end it s a decision for the individual concerned most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable they put truth before comfort and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy that s just hard luck don t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong the short answer is no do you many atheists have been atheists for years they have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of god but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive thousands of years of religious belief haven t resulted in any good proof of the existence of god atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future and they stop worrying about it so why should theists question their beliefs don t the same arguments apply no because the beliefs being questioned are not similar weak atheism is the sceptical default position to take it asserts nothing strong atheism is a negative belief theism is a very strong positive belief atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause not just to the believers but to everyone else what sort of harm religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind it s not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings think of all the time and effort spent building churches praying and so on imagine how that effort could be better spent many theists believe in miracle healing there have been plenty of instances of ill people being healed by a priest ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors and dying as a result some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds it is arguable that the catholic church s opposition to birth control and condoms in particular is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third world countries and contributing to the spread of aids world wide religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion those weren t real believers they just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse what makes a real believer there are so many one true religions it s hard to tell look at christianity there are many competing groups all convinced that they are the only true christians sometimes they even fight and kill each other how is an atheist supposed to decide who s a real christian and who isn t when even the major christian churches like the catholic church and the church of england can t decide amongst themselves in the end most atheists take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone who calls himself a christian and uses christian belief or dogma to justify his actions should be considered a christian maybe some of those christians are just perverting christian teaching for their own ends but surely if the bible can be so readily used to support un christian acts it can t be much of a moral code if the bible is the word of god why couldn t he have made it less easy to misinterpret and how do you know that your beliefs aren t a perversion of what your god intended if there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say so sorry but if someone claims that he believes in jesus and that he murdered others because jesus and the bible told him to do so we must call him a christian obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned but since nobody has ever proved that god does not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs shared by all faiths are nonsense that does not hold because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones nobody has ever proved that unicorns don t exist but that doesn t make it unlikely that they are myths it is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default of course weak atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still well if atheism s so great why are there so many theists unfortunately the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correct it is or whether it works consider how many people believe in astrology graphology and other pseudo sciences many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods certainly in many primitive human societies religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand of course there s more to religion than that in the industrialized world we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world but nowadays it serves other purposes as well but so many cultures have developed religions surely that must say something not really most religions are only superficially similar for example it s worth remembering that religions such as buddhism and taoism lack any sort of concept of god in the christian sense of course most religions are quick to denounce competing religions so it s rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another what about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that god exists for every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god there is one who does not besides as has already been pointed out the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it also it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders a famous scientist is only human she may be an expert in some fields but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise so are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing not entirely it certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far the theory of memetics talks of memes sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds by analogy with genes some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer pressure to keep one time believers from admitting that they were mistaken some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes of course in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it even if religion is not entirely true at least it puts across important messages what are the fundamental messages of atheism there are many important ideas atheists promote the following are just a few of them don t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules be especially sceptical of positive claims if you want your life to have some sort of meaning it s up to you to find it search for what is true even if it makes you uncomfortable make the most of your life as it s probably the only one you ll have it s no good relying on some external power to change you you must change yourself just because something s popular doesn t mean it s good if you must assume something assume something it s easy to test don t believe things just because you want them to be true and finally and most importantly all beliefs should be open to question thanks for taking the time to read this article mathew begin pgp signature version

writes in article robert singleton writes deletion i will argue that your latter statement i believe that no gods exist does rest upon faith that is if you are making a positive statement that no gods exist strong atheism rather than merely saying i don t know and therefore don t believe in them and don t not believe in then weak atheism once again to not believe in god is different than saying i believe that god does not exist i still maintain the position even after reading the faqs that strong atheism requires faith no it in the way it is usually used in my view you are saying here that driving a car requires faith that the car drives i m not saying this at all it requires no faith on my part to say the car drives because i ve seen it drive i ve done more than at in fact i ve actually driven it now what does require some faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation of what s out there but there is no evidence pro or con for the existence or non existence of god see what i have to say below on this for me it is a conclusion and i have no more faith in it than i have in the premises and the argument used sorry if i remain skeptical i don t believe it s entirely a conclusion that you have seen no evidence that there is a god is correct neither have i but lack of evidence for the existence of something is in no way evidence for the non existence of something the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they disprove evolution the establish creation you personally have never seen a neutrino before but they exist the pink unicorn analogy breaks down and is rather naive i have a scientific theory that explains the appearance of animal life evolution when i draw the conclusion that pink unicorns don t exist because i haven t seen them this conclusion has it s foundation in observation and theory a pink unicorn if it did exist would be qualitatively similar to other known entities that is to say since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from more primitive ancestors these pink unicorns would share a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such god however has no such correspondence with anything imo there is no physical frame work of observation to draw any conclusions from but first let me say the following we might have a language problem here in regards to faith and existence i as a christian maintain that god does not exist to exist means to have being in space and time god does not have being god is being kierkegaard once said that god does not exist he is eternal with this said i feel it s rather pointless to debate the so called existence of god and that is not what i m doing here i believe that god is the source and ground of being when you say that god does not exist i also accept this statement but we obviously mean two different things by it however in what follows i will use the phrase the existence of god in it s usual sense and this is the sense that i think you are using it i would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of god no that s a word game i disagree with you profoundly on this i haven t defined god as existence in fact i haven t defined god but this might be getting off the subject although if you think it s relevant we can come back to it further saying god is existence is either a waste of time existence is already used and there is no need to replace it by god or you are implying more with it in which case your definition and your argument so far are incomplete making it a fallacy you are using wrong categories here or perhaps you misunderstand what i m saying i m making no argument what so ever and offering no definition so there is no fallacy i m not trying to convince you of anything i believe and that rests upon faith and it is inappropriate to apply the category of logic in this realm unless someone tells you that they can logically prove god or that they have evidence or then the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary btw an incomplete argument is not a fallacy some things are not even wrong deletion one can never prove that god does or does not exist when you say that you believe god does not exist and that this is an opinion based upon observation i will have to ask what observtions are you refering to there are no observations pro or con that are valid here in establishing a positive belief deletion where does that follow aren t observations based on the assumption that something exists i don t follow you here certainly one can make observations of things that they didn t know existed i still maintain that one can not use observation to infer that god does not exist such a positive assertion requires a leap and wouldn t you say there is a level of definition that the assumption god is is meaningful if not i would reject that concept anyway so where is your evidence for that god is is meaningful at some level once again you seem to completely misunderstand me i have no evidence that god is is meaningful at any level maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of god down your throat i however am not doing this i am arguing one and only one thing that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no

"from fred rice subject re yet more rushdie re islamic law organization monash university melb australia lines in robert knowles writes date sat apr gmt from fred rice in jon livesey writes should we british go around blowing up skyscrapers next i don t know if you are doing so but it seems you are implying that the person accused of blowing up the wtc in ny actually did it and that islamic teachings have something to do with blowing up the wtc wtc world trade centre which was the building that was blown up i think okay to make some comments the person has only been accused innocent until proven guilty remember secondly there seem to be some holes in his accusation that i read about for instance if they guy used that particular van to blow up the building and then to go back and claim his deposit back afterwards he must be incredibly stupid perhaps salamen was one of those uneducated muslims we hear so much about nevertheless he was apparently smart enough to put together a very sophisticated bomb it doesn t seem to fit together somehow actually salameh was not the only person involved the other fellow was a chemical engineer working for allied signal who had specifically studied explosive devices in school believe it or not we actually allow radical muslim types to study things like this in our universities so much for the price of freedom from what i read the other fellow told salameh how to put it together over the phone the bomb was supposedly some sort of sophisticated type so to put a i assume complicated sophisticated bomb together from instructions _over the phone_ one must need some brains i would expect despite this there have already been many attacks and threats against mosques and muslims in the united states as a consequence of his accusation i have read o k now please tell us where this is happening i live in the u s and i have heard very little about these mosque attacks there are many mosques in houston texas and i would like to know what is going on so i can verify this or is the great jewish media conspiracy keeping us from knowing about this in the u s we heard about the mosque attacks during the desert storm venture so why is it so quiet now maybe it is localized to new jersey i read this in an article in the australian muslim times the newspaper weekly of the australian muslim community if this is true perhaps one of the muslims based in north america if they see this posting can elaborate islamic teachings teach against harming the innocent in the qur an it explicitly teaches against harming innocents even in times of war the blowing up of the wtc and harming innocents is therefore in blatant contradiction to islamic teachings this means absolutely nothing plenty of people commit violence while following what they think are valid religious principles i have seen people post many things here from the koran which could be misinterpreted if that is the explanation you wish to use by an uneducated muslim to allow them to harm idolators and unbelievers the first thing every muslim says is that no muslim could have done that because islam teaches against harming innocents and we are supposed to take you word that it never happens what do you think is the consequence does allah strike them down before the alleged violence occurs of course not muslims commit the violent act and then everyone hides behind verses in the koran we re pretty hip to that trick and i even doubt that it will come up in the trials my defense is that i am muslim and islam teaches me not to harm the innocent therefore the people who were killed must not have been innocent sure we set off the bomb your honor but you must remember sir i am a muslim allah is all powerful allah would not have allowed this are you insulting my religion great defense eh just admit that there are some incredibly stupid violent muslims in the world and stop hiding from that fact it does no one any good to deny it it only makes the more reasonable muslims look like they are protecting the bad ones can you see that i don t deny this fact the thrust of my argument here is that a salameh is according to us law innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law as his guilt has not been established it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption b islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents if muslims who perhaps have not realized that islam teaches this perform such actions it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of islam but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the teachings of islam this is an important distinction i should clarify what muslims usually mean when they say muslim in general anyone who calls themselves a muslim and does not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of islam is considered to be a muslim thus one who might do things contrary to islam through ignorance for example does not suddenly _not_ become a muslim if one knowingly transgresses islamic teachings and essential principles though then one does leave islam the term muslim is to be contrasted with mu min which means true believer however whether a muslim is in reality a mu min is something known only by god and perhaps that person himself so you will not find the term mu min used very much by muslims in alt atheism because it is not known to anybody except myself and god whether i for example am a true believer or not for example i could just be putting on a show here and in reality believe something opposite to what i write here without anyone knowing thus when we say muslims we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow islam whether in practice they might in ignorance transgress islamic teachings by muslim we do not necessarily mean mu min or true believer in islam fred rice",1016

"from gary merrill subject re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition originator nntp posting host theseus unx sas com organization sas institute inc lines in article mark fulk writes flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common the crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren t of any use unless they make you do some experiments i ve known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they won t admit out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beers simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dna electrophoresis gel of human alu fragments he got very excited hoping that he d seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays the result was a well conserved or so bp sequence but why do you characterize this as a flight of fancy or a fantasy while i am unfamiliar with the scientific context here it appears obvious that his speculation for lack of a better or more neutral word was at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance of current theory coupled with his observations it would appear that something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation into that theory or to tailor the theory to cover the observation this does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of fancy or a fantasy it is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs irrational perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds the main examples i can think of are from modern high energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole well i think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word also extra scientific etc nor am i prepared to give a general account of rationality in terms of examples there is some danger of beginning to quibble over what a surprising experiment is what counts as surprising etc the same may be said about logical grounds my point is that quite frequently perhaps even most frequently the roots of a new theory can be traced to previously existing theories or even to previously rejected hypotheses of some other theory or domain i would offer some rather well known examples such as toricelli s puy de dome experiment done for the sake of his sea of air hypothesis was this theory and the resulting experimental test surprising well given the prior explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must be counted as so was the theory constructed and the experiment designed out of perfectly rational grounds well there was a pretty successful and well know theory of fluids the analogy to fluids by toricelli is explicit the novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid but this was quite a novelty at the time was the theory interesting yes was it new well one could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new domain but i think this begs certain questions we can debate that if you like gary h merrill principal systems developer c compiler development sas institute inc sas campus dr cary nc mcnc sas sasghm",1036

"from brian finnerty subject mary s assumption organization university of southern california los angeles ca lines a few points about mary s being taken into heaven at the end of her life on earth one piece of evidence for mary s assumption into heaven is the fact that no christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was buried some christian churches claimed to be located at the final resting places of peter mark and other saints but no one ever claimed to possess the body of mary the greatest of the saints why because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of mary some passages seem suggestive like the passage in revelation that describes a woman giving birth to a son and later being crowned in the heavens of course the woman in this passage has other interpretations she can also be taken a symbol for the church the assumption of mary makes sense because of her relationship to christ jesus perfect god and perfect man fulfilled the requirements of the law perfectly under the law god gave to us we are to honor our mother and father and christ s act of taking his mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law also he took his flesh from her so it seems appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave one last point an ex catholic attempted to explain catholic doctrine on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that mary did not die this is not a correct summary of what catholics believe the dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether mary did or did not die in fact the consensus among catholic theologians seems to be that mary in fact did die this would make sense christ died and his mother who waited at the foot of the cross would want to share in his death brian finnerty",1038

"from subject re death penalty gulf war lines in article mathew writes voelkerding writes in article chris blask writes add to this the outrageous cost of putting someone to death special cell block years of court costs extra guards and the benefits of the death penalty entirely disappear that s because of your earlier claim that the one innocent death overrides the benefit of all the others obviously it s tragic but it is no argument for doing away with the death penalty if we went to war and worried about accidentally killing civilians all of the time because our determination of who the enemy really is is imperfect then there is no way to win the war yes fortunately we have right thinking folks like your good self in power and it was therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter tens or even hundreds of thousands of iraqis in order to liberate oil h h hkuwait we won the war hurrah hurrah the number of civilian iraqi deaths were way over exaggerated and exploited for anti war emotionalism by the liberal news media the facts are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century this was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently the idea that hundreds of thousands of iraqi citizens died is ludicrous not even hundreds of thousands of iraqi soldiers died and they were the ones being targeted or do you think that the us and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim iraqi civilians either the smart bombs didn t hit their targets and we know they did or they were targeting civilian targets which is hardly condusive to destroying iraq s military potential the military mission planners are not fools they know they have to hit military targets to win a war hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant dictator ok so some innocent people died yes maybe the unarmed civilians fleeing along that road didn t need to be bombed to bits perhaps that kid with half his face burned off and the little girl with the mangled legs weren t entirely guilty but it s worth the death of a few innocents to save the oil h h hlives of the kuwaiti people isn t it after all the iraqis may not have had a chance to vote for saddam but they showed their acceptance of his regime by not assassinating him right all that surrendering and fleeing along open roads was just a devious ploy we were entirely within our rights to bomb em just in case without finding out if they were soldiers how about all the innocent people who died in blanket bombing in ww i don t hear you bemoaning them war is never an exact science but with smart bombs it s becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties sometimes mistakes are made targets are misidentified innocents die that s war the way it really is but the alternative to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it s one big rummage sale grabbing everything they can get is worse like patrick henry said some years ago i know not what course others may take but as for me give me liberty or give me death war is always the price one must be willing to pay if one wishes to stay free the death penalty was conceived as a deterrent to crime but the legal shenanigans that have been added automatic appeals lengthy court battles etc have relegated that purpose to a very small part of what it should be hence the question is do we instate the death penalty as it was meant to be and see if that deters crime or do we get rid of it entirely yes let s reinstate the death penalty the way it ought to be all that shit about fair trials and a court of appeals just gets in the way of justice let s give the police the absolute right to gun down the guilty and save ourselves the expense of all those lawyers think of the knock on benefits too la would never have had to spend so much money cleaning up after riots and holding showcase trials if the cops had been allowed to do their job properly a quick bullet through the head of rodney king and another for the cameraman and everyone would have been saved a great deal of unnecessary paperwork and expense after all if the police decide a man s guilty that ought to be enough the fact that the death penalty has been shown not to have any deterrent effect over imprisonment well that s entirely irrelevant mathew mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off base here you come off sounding like a complete peace nik idiot although i feel sure that was not your intent so the iraqi war was wrong eh i m sure that appeasement would have worked better than war just like it did in ww eh i guess we shouldn t have fought ww either just think of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg how about all the poor french who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent we should have just let hitler take over europe and you d be speaking german instead of english right now tyrants like hussein have to be stopped his kind don t understand diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun my only regret is that bush wimped out and didn t have the military roll into baghdad so now hussein is still in power and the iraqi people s sacrifice not to mention the americans who died was for naught liberating kuwait was a good thing but wiping hussein off the map would ve been better and as for poor poor rodney king did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i have not seen when one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice a state of mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused whether they be criminals or cops one is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one s guilt and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism regards jim b",1059

no convincing evidence that such a disease exists there s a lot of evidence it just hasn t been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used snort ah there go my sinuses again for example dr ivker who wrote the book sinus survival always gives oh wow a classic textbook hey they laughed at einstein too before any other treatment a systemic anti fungal such as nizoral to his new patients if they ve been on braod spectrum anti biotics or more times in the last two years he s kept a record of the results and for over patients found that over of his patients get significant relief of allergic sinus symptoms of course this is only the beginning for his program yeah i ll bet tomorrow the world listen uncontrolled studies like this are worthless in my case as i reported a few weeks ago i was developing the classic symptoms outlined in the yeast connection i agree it is a poorly written book e g extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc which i never had before started in november within one week of full dosage of sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared i can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes i m also greatly improved in other areas as well i m sure you are you sound like the typical hysteric hypochondriac who responds to miracle cures of course i have allergy symptoms etc i am especially allergic to molds yeasts etc it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms yeah it makes sense to me so of course it should be taken seriously snort also yeast do produce toxins of various sorts and again you don t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people yeah it sounds reasonable to me of course the question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed i was from over years of antibiotics nutritionally deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies etc oh really _what_ tests immune compromised my ass more like credulous malingerer this is a psychiatric syndrome can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body it is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy one almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis fortunately sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti fungals still have to be careful however so there s no reason any longer to withhold sporanox treatment for empirical reasons you know it s a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused in this way it s ridiculously expensive and potentially toxic the trouble is that it isn t toxic enough so it gets abused by quacks btw some would say to try nystatin unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for nystatin to have any permanent affect you ll find a lot of people who are on nystatin all the time the only good thing about nystatin is that it s relatively cheap and when taken orally non toxic but oral nystatin is without any systemic effect so unless it were given iv it would be without any effect on your sinuses i wish these quacks would first use iv nystatin or amphotericin b on people like you that would solve the yeast problem once and for all in summary i appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road but methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven t been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients if anybody doctors included said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection i can not guarantee their safety for their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as far as i am concerned perhaps a little haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating your symptoms are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket i d hate to think my insurance premiums are going towards this steve dyer dyer you re rude medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour it s often practiced in a disorganized manner most early treatment of non life threatening illness is done on a guess hazarded after anecdotal evidence given by the patient it s an educated guess by a trained person but it s still no more than a guess it s cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those people who don t respond there are diseases that haven t been described yet and the root cause of many diseases now described aren t known read a book on gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them after scientific methods have run out then it s the patient s freedom of choice to try any experimental method they choose and it s well recognized by many doctors that medicine doesn t have all the answers this person said that they had relief by taking the medicine maybe it s a miracle cure maybe it s valid how do you know you might argue with the reasoning the conclusions but your disparaging attack is unwarranted why don t you present an convincing argument for you r beliefs instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack jackie",1068

"from charley wingate subject re gospel dating lines benedikt rosenau writes the argument goes as follows q oid quotes appear in john but not in the almost codified way they were in matthew or luke however they are considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of q as such and not an entirely different source assuming you are presenting it accurately i don t see how this argument really leads to any firm conclusion the material in john i m not sure exactly what is referred to here but i ll take for granted the similarity to the matt luke q material is different hence one could have almost any relationship between the two right up to john getting it straight from jesus mouth we are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors the usual explanation for the time order of mark matthew and luke does not consider their respective ages it says matthew has read the text of mark and luke that of matthew and probably that of mark the version of the usual theory i have heard has matthew and luke independently relying on mark and q one would think that if luke relied on matthew we wouldn t have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies for one thing as it is assumed that john knew the content of luke s text the evidence for that is not overwhelming admittedly this is the part that is particularly new to me if it were possible that you could point me to a reference i d be grateful unfortunately i haven t got the info at hand it was i think in the late s or early s and it was possibly as old as ce when they are from about why do they shed doubt on the order on putting john after the rest of the three because it closes up the gap between supposed writing and the existing copy quit a bit the further away from the original the more copies can be written and therefore survival becomes more probable and i don t think a one step removed source is that bad if luke and mark and matthew learned their stories directly from diciples then i really can not believe in the sort of big transformation from jesus to gospel that some people posit in news reports one generally gets no better information than this and if john is a diciple then there s nothing more to be said that john was a disciple is not generally accepted the style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument i m not really impressed with the theology argument but i m really pointing this out as an if and as i pointed out earlier one can not make these arguments about i peter i see no reason not to accept it as an authentic letter one step and one generation removed is bad even in our times compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies the best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants which is not so bad in other words one does not know what the original of mark did look like and arguments based on mark are pretty weak but the statement of divinity is not in that section and in any case it s agreed that the most important epistles predate mark c wingate the peace of god it is no peace but strife closed in the sod yet brothers pray for but one thing tove mangoe the marv lous peace of god",1088
"from lee lady subject re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition summary asking the wrong question is the most fundamental error keywords science errors turpin organization university of hawaii mathematics dept expires mon may gmt lines avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable however it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity and in ordinary life perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder in the extreme case a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house in science we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries usually there is some trade off between these two desiderata the search for scope and the search for certainty if th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from newton and leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense since they lacked the concept of a limit and in fact because of the lack of a rigorous foundation they made a number of errors in their use of calculus it was only a hundred years later that weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of newton and leibniz nonetheless what newton and leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made in article dick king writes somebody writes i doubt if einstein used any formal methodology he also proposed numerous experiments which if performed would distinguish a universe in which special relativity holds from one in which it does not einstein played by the rules which demand that hypotheses only be put out there if there exists a specific experiment that could disprove them these are not the rules according to many who post to sci med and sci psychology according to these posters if it s not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it s not science taken to the extreme i believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science for one thing an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific trade unionism where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing i don t in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology nonetheless it is one of the results and although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results i think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment and using less than perfect empirical methodology will ever come with anything worthwhile furthermore the big bucks approach to science promotes what i think is one of the most significant errors in science choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance for instance certain questions can not be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative one could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology in my opinion a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to russell turpin s assertion that current scientific methods avoid all known errors i think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others and i think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects",1089

can not believe the way this thread on candida yeast has progressed steve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci med nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a woman poster for being treated by a licenced physician for a disease that did not exist calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well they are just responding in their natural way hyper choleric syndrome hcs oops that is not a recognized illness in the psychological community better not say that since it therefore must not and never will exist actually it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as nt for those not familiar with the myers briggs system just e mail me and i ll send a summary file to you in the general population nt s comprise only about of the population but among physicians it is much much higher i don t know the exact percentage any help here a p p er s one driving characteristic of an nt especially an ntj is their obvious choleric behavior driver type a etc the extreme emotional need to control to lead and or to be the best or the most competent if they are also extroverted they are best described as field marshalls this trait is very valuable and essential in our society we need people who want to lead to strive to overcome the elements to seek and thirst for knowledge to raise the level of competency etc the great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision an n trait and scientifically minded approach t trait of the nt personality of course the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well however when the nt person has self image challenges the dark side of this personality type usually comes out which should be obvious to all a physician who is a strong nt and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business like lack of empathy or feeling and is very compelled to have total control over their patient the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question i ve known many m d s of this temperament and suffice to say i don t oblige them with a followup visit no matter how competent i think they are and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs to know the most to know it all maybe we need more nf doctor s enough on this subject let s move on to candida bloom let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it s environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics could it just be professional jealousy i couldn t help elaine or jon but somebody else did you ve helped me already by your post of course i believe that i have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from anal retentivitis but being the phlegmatic i am maybe i was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts let s all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier in my well described situation in prior posts i definitely was immune stressed blood tests showed my vitamin a levels were very low my sinuses were a mess no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged i also was on antibiotics times in years in the end even two weeks of ceftin did not work and i had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat scans mucus color won t get into the details and other symptoms three very traditional ent s made this diagnosis i did not have any cultures done however because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection enough of this background provided to help you understand where i was when i make comments about my sporanox anti fungal therapy below the first question i have is this can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without being considered systemic in the classic sense it is sort of an inbetween infection steve got real upset with elaine s doctor because he was using anti fungals and vitamin a for her gi problems if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body he would not or at least should not be calling elaine s doctor a quack i was concerned too because of the toxicity of vitamin a my doctor after my blood tests put me on iu of vitamin a for one week only then dropped it down to iu for the next couple of weeks i also received zinc and other supplementation since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained he s one of those evil orthomolecular specialists i had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin a was normal he then stopped me on all vitamin a except for some in a multi vitamin supplement and made sure that i maintain a iu day of beta carotene call me carrot face hopefully elaine s doctor will take a similar careful approach and to all supplements i m even reevaluating some supplements i m taking for example niacin in fairly large dosages gram day which steve dyer had good information about on sci med nutrition if niacin only has second order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long term and risking liver damage survives if it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina in though i do now believe based on my successful therapy with sporanox that i definitely had some excessive growth of fungus unknown species in my sinuses i still want to ask the question have there been any studies that demonstrate candida blooms in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation sinusitis rhinitis my sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time i did not have any noticeable gi track problems before starting on sporanox but some for a few days after which then went away considered normal btw my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books sorry can t remember which one and found an obscure comment dating back into the s which stated that people can develop contained non lethal or non serious aspergillis infestations aspergiliosis of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms i ll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn t certain my doctor tested me i believe a rast or rast similar test for allergic response to specificially candida albicans and i showed a strong positive another question would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless and assuming it is true that candida can grow part way into the mucus membrane tissue and the concentration exceeds a threshold amount could not a person who tests as having an allergy to candida definitely develop allergic symptoms such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body s allergic response as i said in an earlier post one does not need to be a rocket scientist or have a m d degree or a ph d in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis btw and i ll repost this again dr ivker in his book sinus survival has routinely given before anything else nizoral a pre sporanox systemic anti fungal not as safe and not as good as sporanox to his new chronic sinusitis patients if they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years he claims that out of or so patients well over notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms but it doesn t cure it by any means implying the so called yeast fungus infection is not the primary cause but a later complication he s also found that nystatin whether taken internally or put into a sinus spray does not help this implies of course assuming that excessive yeast fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation that the yeast fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast fungus other than by direct contact it is not absorbed into the blood stream again i admit lots of ifs and implies which doesn t please the hard core nt who has to have the double blind study or it s a non issue but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis explanation a strawman if you will if it s internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondescript this brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until the appropriate studies are done and that is if you can t observe or culture the yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then there s no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease and i know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that can not be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body it s a real catch another catch those who totally reject the yeast hypothesis say that no studies have been done actually studies have been done but if it s not up to a certain standard then it is from their perspective a non study which should not even be considered i agree that the appropriate studies should be done and that will take big to do it right however in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets you literally have to give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding that is you have to do of the study before you even get funding as a scientist at a national lab i m very aware of this for the smaller funded projects i m afraid that even if dr ivker and other doctors got together pooled their practice s case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture and approach the funding agencies they would get nowhere even if they were able to publish their statistical results it is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have decided excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non lethal symptoms does not exist and is not even a tenable hypothesis so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it s a done issue excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not will not and can not exist period kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint kind of reminds me of lister candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the gi tract mouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets about of all american s die with less vitamin a than they were born with u s autopsy studies while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathology blindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom aren t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia while diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the anti fungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then anti fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr steve dyer says again the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast fungus species can grow hyphae roots into deep tissue similar to mold growing in bread you can continue to kill the surface such as nystatin does but you can t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti fungal such as itraconazole sporanox or some of the older ones such as nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective this is why as has been pointed out by recent studies sent to me by a doctor i ve been in e mail contact with thanks that nystatin is not effective in the long term treatment of gi tract candidiasis it s like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away the question is whether a contained candida bloom can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people e g allergy without becoming systemic in the classical sense of the word something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal in the gi system the ano rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear also if one is an anal retentive like i ve been diagnosed in a prior post that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan has told me throiugh e mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives candida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on a constant basis i would want it fixed yes it s nice to know that i don t have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me better steve dyer calls him a quack as i ve said in private e mail there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies after the approved proven accepted therapies don t work for example i went to three ent s who all said that i will just have to live with my acute chronic sinusitis after the ab s failed they did mention surgery to open up the ostia but my ostia weren t plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition after three months of aggressive and fairly non standard therapy sporanox body nutrient level monitoring and equalization vitamin c lentinen echinacea etc my health has vastly improved to where i was two years ago before my health greatly deteriorated of course skeptics would say that maybe if i did nothing i would have improved anyway but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ent s i saw who said that i d just have to live with it i m confident i will reach what one could call a total cure the anti fungal program i undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab s for the last four years note for those having sinus problems may i suggest the book by dr ivker i mention above be sure to get the revised edition i have often wondered what an m d with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non existent syndrome dr ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems and his visits to several ent s totally floored him when they said you ll just have to live with it he spent several years trying everything standard and non standard until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis he now shares his approach in his book and i can honestly say that i am on the road to recovery following some parts of it his one recommendation to take a systemic anti fungal at the beginning of treatment if you have a history of anti biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice i m sure if i commented to him of the hard core beliefs of the anti yeast hypothesis posters that he would have definite things to say such as it s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases to put it mildly i also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the hypothetical yeast overgrowth e g they fit some of the profiles the pro yeast people have identified should consider anti fungal therapy if all other avenues have been exhausted remember theory and practice are two different things you can not have one without the other they are synergistic if a doctor does something non standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients shouldn t you at least sit up and take notice maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn t work i m afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with scientific correctness that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help you have to do both both have to be balanced which we don t see from some of the posters to this group there comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense and maybe an empirical approach such as trying a good systemic anti fungal such as sporanox after having exhausted all the other avenues i was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help so i did the natural thing i went to a couple of doctor s who are somewhat outside this establishment and as a result i have found significant relief would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor without fear of being sued or having his license pulled can try experimental and unproven beyond a doubt therapies for his her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective i d like to hear a doctor tell me well i ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country and since they clearly don t work for you i now have the authority to use experimental unproven techniques that seem to have helped others i can t promise anything and there are some risks you will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies and i ll have to register your case at the state board anyway if my ent had suggested this to me i would ve jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who for either altruistic reasons or for greed is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him her risk meaning losing their license and possibly to the patient such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free it also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient that it s doing everything it can within reason to help the patient it is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies some of which seem to work like my case and others of which will never work at all true quackery i better get off my soapbox before this post reaches k in size if taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes but before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the b complex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b and folate these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non existent disorder candida blooms after antibiotic therapy what dosage of b appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper working of the mucos memebranes some of the above material was obtained from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gi system is involved if candida can not get glucose it s not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut i d like to see the role of complex carbohydrates such as starch if steve and some of the other nay sayers want to jump all over this post fine i jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor s use of vitamin a and anti fungals for a candida bloom in her gut people seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart s content if you saved your venom for me steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help alone i wouldn t

"from subject re death penalty gulf war lines in article mathew writes writes in article mathew writes yes fortunately we have right thinking folks like your good self in power and it was therefore deemed acceptable to slaughter tens or even hundreds o thousands of iraqis in order to liberate oil h h hkuwait we won the war hurrah hurrah the number of civilian iraqi deaths were way over exaggerated and exploited for anti war emotionalism by the liberal news media the facts are that less iraqis died in the gulf war than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century let s analyze this claim a little how is the size of a war defined by number of participants geographical area number of countries involved number of casualties size of armies duration numbers of casualties both absolute and as a percentage of those involved geographical area and numbers of countries too are all measures of size in this case i d say the relevant statistic would be the number of combatants total troops compared to total casualties from among the total civilian population in the affected geographical area which other comparable wars are we talking about vietnam and korea might make good comparisons which liberal news media are we talking about western news in general but in particular the american mass media cbs nbc abc etc the general tone of the news during the whole war was one of those poor poor iraqis along with look how precisely this cruise missile blew this building to bits this was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently i suspect that medical advances may have something to do with it too i agree how about all the innocent people who died in blanket bombing in ww i don t hear you bemoaning them perhaps because the topic hasn t cropped up if you want my opinion i think that the blanket bombing of german cities at the end of world war two was the most appalling act of wholesale slaughter this country has committed in centuries bomber harris was no hero of mine perhaps so and maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too but that s easy to say from our enlightened viewpoint here in the s right back then it was all out war and germany and japan had to be squashed after all a million or more british had already died hundreds of thousands of french a couple hundread thousand or so americans and millions of russians not to mention a few million jews poles and other people of slavic descent in german concentration camps all things considered the fire bombings and the atomic bomb were essential and therefore justified in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied losses i for one don t regret it war is never an exact science but with smart bombs it s becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties sometimes mistakes are made targets are misidentified innocents die that s war the way it really is entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests without regard for the lives of other people that is the way war really is sure and it s the people who suffer because of them all the more reason to depose these entrenched political rulers operating in their own selfish interests or do you mean that this applies to the allies as well why all the fuss about kuwait and not east timor bosnia or even tibet if iraq is so bad why were we still selling them stuff a couple of weeks before we started bombing i make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the west before the war it is evident that the west especially america misjudged hussein drastically but once hussein invaded kuwait and threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world s oil supply he had to be stopped sure the war could have been prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the west before hussein invaded kuwait but it is still hussein who is responsible for his decision to invade and once he did so a strong response from the west was required mathew your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off base here you come off sounding like a complete peace nik idiot although i feel sure that was not your intent what s your intent to sound like a loving christian well you aren t doing a very good job of it well it s not very loving to allow a hussein or a hitler to gobble up nearby countries and keep them or to allow them to continue with mass slaughter of certain peoples under their dominion so i d have to say yes stopping hussein was the most loving thing to do for the most people involved once he set his mind on military conquest so the iraqi war was wrong eh i m sure that appeasement would have worked better than war just like it did in ww eh who even mentioned appeasement and what makes you think the situation is even remotely analogous to world war two i mentioned it if we hadn t intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeasement it is precisely the lessons the world learned in ww that motivated the western alliance to war letting hitler take austria and czechoslavkia did not stop ww from happening and letting hussein keep kuwait would not have stopped an eventual gulf war to protect saudi arabia i guess we shouldn t have fought ww either just think of all those innocent german civilians killed in dresden and hamburg yes do germans are human too you know sure what was truly unfortunate was that they followed hitler in his grandiose quest for a thousand year reich the consequences stemmed from that tyrants like hussein have to be stopped his kind don t understand diplomacy they only understand the point of a gun my only regret is that bush wimped out and didn t have the military roll into baghdad so now hussein is still in power and the iraqi people s sacrifice not to mention the americans who died was for naught i look forward to hearing your incisive comments about east timor and tibet what should i say about them anything in particular and as for poor poor rodney king did you ever stop and think why the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of not guilty yes amongst the things i thought were hmm there s an awful lot of white people in that jury so it was the policemen on trial not rodney king and under american law they deserved a jury of their peers if there had been black officers involved i m sure their would have been black jurors too this point of allegedly racial motivations is really shallow those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape but the jury looked at all the evidence evidence which you and i have not seen when i see a bunch of policemen beating someone who s lying defenceless on the ground it s rather hard to imagine what this other evidence might have been so it s hard to imagine so when has argument from incredulity gained acceptance from the revered author of constructing a logical argument can we expect another revision soon just kidding if there is some wonderful evidence why is it seemingly being kept secret why not tell everyone what it is then everyone could say oh yes you re right king deserved a good beating and we could all live happily ever after i have to admit that i wonder this too but neither the prosecution nor the defense is talking so one can not conclude either way due to the silence of the principals law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused whether they be criminals or cops one is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one s guilt and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict fine but i m still finding it hard to imagine what the reasonable doubt was in this case i mean the cops certainly seem to be beating someone who s lying defenceless on the ground what s your explanation mass hallucination orbital mind control lasers faked video footage do tell ok it certainly seemed to me that there was excessive force involved and frankly the original not guilty verdict baffled me too but then i learned that the prosecution in the first case did not try to convict on a charge of excessive force or simple assault which they probably would have won they tried to get a conviction on a charge of aggravated assault with intent to inflict serious bodily harm a charge which news commentators said was akin to attempted murder under california law based on what the prosecution was asking for it s evident that the first jury decided that the officers were not guilty note not not guilty of doing wrong but not guilty of aggravated assault with the intent of inflicting serious bodily harm the seeds of the prosecutions defeat were in their own overconfidence in obtaining a verdict such that they went for the most extreme charge they could if the facts as the news commentators presented them are true then i feel the not guilty verdict was a reasonable one mathew thou shalt not kill unless thou hast a pretty good reason for killing in which case thou shalt kill and also kill anyone who gets in the way as unfortunately it can not be helped jim brown bible for loving christians thanks mathew i like the quote pretty funny actually i m a monty python fan you know kind of seems in that vein of

"from mark gregory foster subject re sabbath admissions of organization walla walla college lines in article darius_lecointe writes faq and darius response deleted darius it s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq i think paul s comments on esteeming one day over another rom is probably all that needs to be said i accept that darius is doing what he does in honor of the lord i just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing their best to honor the lord i am myself an sda and i am in total agreement with what darius has to say i also worship on saturday to honor the lord your mention of esteeming all days alike imo has to do with the fast days observed by the jews but no matter how you interpret that passage i do accept your worship on sunday as being done in honor of the lord in contrast with what many of my fellow sda believers may believe to me though the bible overwhelmingly points to saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of god s deliverance of the israelites from egyptian bondage to those who would attempt to point out that my observance of saturday is being legalistic this is simply not the case rather keeping saturday allows me a full day to rest and contemplate god s goodness and grace however i d like to be clear that i do not think there s unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day as i indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited similarly with cor it says that on the first day they should set aside money for paul s collection now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this or that they did it in their homes i can t disprove it but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day the idea was introduced to me once that the reason paul wanted the corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the week was because that was when they received their weekly wages paul wanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority before spending their money on other things i do not have any proof in front of me for this though although it would explain why they would lay aside money in their homes instead of a meeting so i think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day of every week simply means every time they gather for worship i think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christian worship was it would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the nt regularly worshipped on the first day i assume that the christians in the nt regularly worshipped on the seventh day but i agree with you that we only have implications because the authors did assume the reader knew when worhip was mark",1154

serious attempt to foster dialog and rest assurred that i make every attempt to make fun of no one except myself eric molas writes firstly i am an atheist i am not posting here as an immature flame start but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience the human being is an _animal_ who has due to his her advanced mental facilities developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable hmmm there are other animals on this planet with advanced mental facilities which have not developed religion as a satisfactory explaination for the unexplained why is this so further it appears that only humans have a need to explain the unexplained why is this so the other animals on this planet including those with advanced mental facilities seem perfectly content in their ignorance i d like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me from your unsupported statement they are humans are animal only religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need not be researched religion was made up by humans to address a perceived need the biological aspect of humans is deified that is all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical structure with biology at the apex needless to say i disagree with your strong opinion and the underlying presuppositions christianity is an infectious cult the reasons it flourishes are because it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind oh wow all i have to do is follow this christian moral standard and i get eternal happiness for all of you found jeezus how many of you were on the brink i disagree that christianity is an infectious cult it has certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system in spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia that it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is infectious in a derrogatory sense it may be that it provides a workable system for its adherents and i would argue that this is the case i disagree that christianity is a safety blanket which supplants hope and purpose rather it points an individual to the one source of hope and purpose there is nothing hidden about a christian s source for hope and purpose of what usefulness to you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose and externally given hope and purpose is the apparent loss of control over one s own life the problem or is it something else finally one does not appropriate eternal happiness by following christian moral standards indeed the sole reason for the existance of christianity is because standards are inadequate to save people from their imperfections moral standards are merely guides to the christian the real power to moral living is given to the christian in the person of god s spirit heaven is one of two final states that christian doctrine postulates however christians are generally not motivated to live according to christian moral standards by this promised future reward rather they are motivated by the perceived benefits to them in the here and now but i digress the other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature a best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this priority spread the word many christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a priority and rightly so for it was jesus himself who gave this as a priority for his followers however it is not the penultimate priority as evangelism is normally understood i e preach the word convert at nearly any cost repeat with new convert ad infinitum rather such evangelism is generally best done through respecting the opinions of others while demonstrating the very real benefits of a christian lifestyle this demonstration should be so powerful that it compels the non christian to seek out the christian to ask why needless to say such a demonstration is not easily accom plished it takes a radical committment to the person of jesus it does not happen quickly so perseverance on the part of the christian is required and it can not occur where no personal bonds of friendship exist it is ineffective with strangers who can not evaluate the demonstration over time and it is easy to alienate or harm others if the sole purpose of being a friend is to gain a conversion as a long time christian nearly years i view with some skep ticism all evangelism programs which incorporate a hurry up attitude pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no conversion at all because the pressured convert realizes s he was coerced and disavows christianity when they would have been open to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now the bible states that it is the very spirit of god which brings conviction of wrong doing to people i am content to do my part witness and let the spirit do the rest we are _just_ animals we need sleep food and we reproduce and we die we are far more than animals we sleep eat reproduce and die just as other animals do true but we are also capable of more than this if your personal vision of humanity or of yourself is so limited i can only hope and pray that you will someday find a more expansive view for reflection what animals have the wide variety of performing arts that humans do how is it that humans can learn the language of other humans or animals but that other animals can not do so how is it that humans can organize themselves in various social structures whereas other animals have only one structure religion especially christianity is nothing more than a drug blatant assertion christianity is not physically addictive christianity is not psychologically addictive christianity is not a thing which one snorts ingests shoots up it is a relationship with a living being you might as validly characterize any close knit relationship with this appelation some people use drugs as an escape from reality christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high there are jesus freaks who let the emotional aspects of worship and christian living gain and retain the upper hand even so this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these things flow it pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars of which christianity has had no small part guilty by association that christianity which forces itself upon another is not christianity at all when christians see a non believer they say that person is blind to the truth but they can not realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day jesus was just prophet who happened to have a large influence because at that time the romans were circa ad dispersing the jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need you appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened years ago how did you come by it i can not accept your conclusion that jesus influence was a sole result of the roman sack of jerusalem in ad he was years gone by this time it strains the bounds of credulity to assert that nothing about jesus life was noteworthy _until_ the sack i must go these are but a few of my thoughts on christianity christianity is having a relationship with

"from nigel allen subject water supplies vulnerable to milwaukee type disease outbreak organization r node public access unix lines here is a press release from the natural resources defense council new data show about major u s water supplies vulnerable to milwaukee type disease outbreak to national desk environment writer contact erik olson or sarah silver both of the natural resources defense council washington april internal epa data released today by the natural resources defense council reveals that about large water systems serving cities from boston to san francisco do not filter to remove disease carrying organisms leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease outbreak similar to the one affecting milwaukee the epa list is attached these internal epa documents reveal that the safety of water supplies in many american cities is threatened by inadequate pollution controls or filtration said erik olson a senior attorney with nrdc water contamination isn t just a problem in bangladesh it s also a problem in bozeman and boston as of june about large surface water systems on epa s list probably will be breaking the law the safe drinking water act requires all surface water systems to either filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use from pollution olson continued some systems are moving towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are expected to miss the law s deadline olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already a reality in other cities a survey of u s surface water systems by water utility scientists found that percent of raw water samples contained the milwaukee organism cryptosporidium and percent contained a similar parasite called giardia adding to the level of concern a general accounting office study released today by house health and environment subcommittee chairman henry waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the nation s system for conducting and following through on sanitary surveys of water systems this new information raises a huge warning sign that millions of americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be assured that their water is safe to drink we must immediately put into place programs to protect water sources from contamination and where this is not assured filtration equipment must be installed to protect the public olson noted the time has come for many of the nation s water utilities to stop dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from contamination consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs needed to assure

"from gerry palo subject re christianity and repeated lives lines in article writes gerry palo writes there is nothing in christianity that precludes the idea of repeated lives on earth the apostle paul romans points out that god chose jacob rather than esau to be the ancestor of the covenant people and ultimately of the messiah and that he made this choice while the two boys were still in their mother s womb and therefore could not possibly have done anything good or evil to deserve their appointed destinies if we admit the possibility that they had lived previous lives and that in accordance with the asiatic idea of karma their present lives are a reward or punishment for past behaviour this makes nonsense of paul s whole point the existence of repeated earth lives and destiny karma does not mean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds there is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction but i did not subscribe to that view god may choose one individual over another as the fit instrument for his plans but that does not preclude that the development of that individual into what he is in this earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development i do not and rudolf steiner did not subscribe to the oriental view of an inexorable mechanistic karma determining everything that befalls one this is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater law in the context of which the deed of christ on golgotha and the ultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of christ can be seen as the master theme and indeed a new impulse that was completely free of karma christ incarnated only once in the flesh and in that he had no debt of karma or sin the oriental concepts of reincarnation and karma which are even more trivialized and mechanized in some new age teachings incorrectly assume jesus christ to have been the reincarnation of a master avatar etc their teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the continuing individuality from one life to the next e g buddhism more important they have no concept of the resurrection of the body the ultimate continuity of the whole human being to ultimate resurrection and judgement on the last day there is another biblical passage that also has a bearing it is the tenth chapter of john devoted almost entirely to the man born blind clearly here jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma or that of his parents that led to his blindness but rather that a new impulse is to be revealed through him but note that he does not refute the disciples question in fact they ask it as a matter of course the question being stated as if it were self evident that only one of two possibilities existed it was either the sins of the man himself obviously not in this incarnation or the sins of his parents the fact that they even asked about the first possibility at all indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of christ s answer indicates that he did not disagree with it there is also matthew where jesus says straight out about john the baptist if you care to accept it he himself is elias who was to come this also emphasizes that the gospels do not have a positive teaching either way about reincarnation or in fact about what happens to the human being at all between death and the last day even jesus did not push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it if you care to accept it so i took care to point out not that the bible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either and that much in both scripture and fundamental christian doctrine becomes understandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way i pointedly used repeated earth lives to distinguish a little from the oriental doctrines usually associated with the word reincarnation the phrase is rudolf steiner s wiederholte erdenleben he noted too that the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west completely free from eastern tradition it did in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the most important expression of it being lessing s the education of the human race to return to your original point paul s statement about jacob and esau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma and both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the incarnation death and resurrection ascension and return of jesus christ in my view regards gerry palo",1189

"from subject god morality and massacres lines a listmember d andrew killie i think wrote in response to the suggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of god any god who works that way is indescribably evil and unworthy of my worship or faith nobuya higgy higashiyama replied as in substance did others where is your source of moral standards by which you judge god s behavior it is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge god s actions who is the clay to talk back to the potter but we find a contrary view in scripture when god proposes to destroy the city of sodom genesis abraham says suppose that there are some good men in the city will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked far be it from you lord to do such a thing shall not the judge of all the earth do right i am told that the hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this and can perhaps be better rendered dynamic equivalence as shame on you lord if you do such a thing there are those who say that the definition of good is whatever god happens to want but if that is so then the statement that god is good has no meaning it simply says that god does what he wants that being the case no one can either love or obey god because he is good the only motive left for obeying him is that he is powerful just as it makes sense to obey a dictator even when he tells you to round up all jews and exterminate them because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself so it makes sense to obey god because he has the power to punish you if you don t this ethical theory i take to be in radical contradiction to genesis and to christianity in general any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality or of the goodness of god meaningless however it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result when i read the scriptural accounts of the actions of god in history those actions often seem to me very different from what i might expect of a god who loves us and desires what is best for us moreover leaving the scriptures aside and considering the natural world i find that nature is often very different from what i might expect if it were the work of a benevolent deity origen said those who believe that the author of nature is also the author of the scriptures must expect to find in the scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in nature now that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence power wisdom and goodness of god on the contrary their absence would be such an argument suppose that i am watching bobby fisher play chess and suppose that every time he makes a move i find myself nodding and saying good move just what i was expecting him to do same move i would have made if i were playing that would be a sign that fisher is no better a chess player than myself given that he is better i expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking now what do suppose induced him to do that or even boy that was a real slip he s just thrown the game away similarly if god understands the workings of the universe better than i do it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if he has made a mistake one difference between fisher at the chessboard and god at the controls of the universe is that i can see the end of the chess game if fisher wins i revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen moves earlier however if he loses and particularly if i can see that there was a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did not take it then i know that he is not as good a player as i had thought with god on the other hand i shall not in this life see the total result of some of his actions therefore my grounds for judging that i have seen a bad move on his part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making a similar judgement about fisher in the book of genesis we read that joseph s ten older brothers who with good reason found him insufferable conspired to sell him into slavery in egypt there he eventually became viceroy and when there was a famine in canaan he was able to provide for his family when his brothers nervously apologized he told them do not worry you meant to do me evil but god turned it into good i once heard a rabbi speak on this text he said the history of the jews is largely a history of events that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued survival of the religion or the people or both but amazingly those events turn out to be the saving of the jews and of judaism the sale of joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup of the family but in fact it ended with a reconciliation of the quarrel between them the famine that drove the family out of canaan looked like a misfortune for them but in fact if they had stayed in canaan they would almost certainly have intermarried with the canaanites and been assimilated into their culture their oppression by the egyptians a few generations after their arrival in egypt again looked like a disaster but god used it to bring them out of egypt and into the promised land here the people built a temple and regularly offered sacrifices but the babylonians captured jerusalem and judea destroyed temple and city and countryside and deported most of the people to babylon you might have thought that that would be the end of the people and the religion but it was not living in canaan the people had been under constant danger of assimilation again and again they had turned from the worship of the lord to the worship of the canaanite fertility cults with their ritual prostitution and ritual human sacrifice the babylonian captivity put a stop to that never again did the jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry neither the worship of the canaanites mor that of the babylonians ever again had a foothold among them nor is that all judaism had been in danger of becoming simply a system of sacrifices and temple observances the only prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to jerusalem every so often and offering a sacrifice during the captivity with the temple gone the jews invented the synagogue a place of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the scriptures they came to realize clearly what they were in danger of forgetting while they continued to live in judea that god is not simply a local or tribal deity not just the controller of the land of canaan or the patron of the jewish people but the creator of the world and the ruler and judge of all humans everywhere time passed and the babylonian empire was replaced by that of the persians and then that of the greeks or rather the macedonians the ruler antiochus epiphanes was determined to stamp out judaism and to this end he made the reading and the study of the torah punishable by death again one might think that this would be the end of judaism but it was not the people met for worship and instead of reading the torah portion appointed for the day they would read some passage from the prophets that had a similar theme and then discuss that before this time the torah the so called five books of moses genesis exodus leviticus numbers and deuteronomy were the only books read and studied in the synagogue if it had not been for antiochus the books of the prophets would probably have been forgotten altogether his hatred for judaism saved them other examples here omitted for brevity s sake some of you may remember that julie andrews first became famous as eliza doolittle in the stage production of my fair lady when warner brothers undertook to make a movie of it everyone expected that julie who had been so magnificent on stage would play the same role in the movie instead the studio decided to go with an established screen star and cast audrey hepburn julie andrews was naturally crushed but she later realized that if she had played the screen role she would have been type cast for life as an elize doolittle type it would have been a disaster for her as it was walt disney offered her the role of mary poppins and she won an oscar for it at the presentation she stood there smiling and looking at walt disney she said and now my special thanks to the man who made all this possible jack warner it was the most memorable line of the evening in a similar spirit we jews might thank the men who in the providence of god have preserved judaism and kept it alive to this day beginning with joseph s brothers and continuing with two pharaohs with nebuchadnezzar with antiochus epiphanes after the formal meeting had broken up one woman came up to him privately and said you were talking about the holocaust weren t you he answered if that is an example that came to your mind then you are right i was talking about it to you but i would not talk about it to everyone for not everyone can bear it i assume that he meant that without the holocaust there would have been no state of israel someone hearing the rabbi s lecture might leap to the conclusion that god is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish his purposes or at least that the rabbi thought so he might then go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact god s doing that he stirred up joseph s brothers to a murderous hate against him and that when the israelites were in egypt god hardened pharaoh s heart so that he oppressed the people and would not let them go and this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that god has brought about i suggest another way of looking at it consider a sculptor who has a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue but the log instead of having a smooth even grain throughout has a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface the sculptor considers the wood for a while and then carves a statue that features the knot that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue so that observers will say how fortunate the sculptor was in finding a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place its presence is the crowning touch the thing that makes the statue a great work of art in reality the knot far from being what the sculptor was looking for was a challenge to his skill if the wood had not contained that flaw he would still have made a great work of art but a different one so if joseph s brothers had not sold him god would still have brought about his purposes for the jewish people but he would have done so in another manner if judas had not betrayed jesus if caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected jesus but had rather acknowledged him as the annointed of god if pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set jesus free it might appear that there would have been no crucifixion and therefore no redemption and therefore no salvation not so god did not need judas sin to redeem us if judas had done right then god in christ would still have reconciled the world to himself we do not know how just as we do not know how michelangelo would have painted the sistine chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like grand central station and just as we do not know how bobby fisher would have won his fourth game agianst spassky if spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked fisher s knight instead don t bother to look up the game in question i am making up this example but the point is none the less valid thus we may say both that god used say the cowardice of pilate to accomplish his purposes and that the said cowardice was not god s doing and that pilate would not have thwarted god s plans by behaving justly and courageously what then are we to make of the place where god says to moses i will harden pharaoh s heart so that he will not let the people go some christians have taken this to mean that pharaoh was a puppet with god pulling the strings and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work but the work of god in him i suppose rather that what god was telling moses was something like this if you see that pharaoh is not willing to let the people go do not be discouraged or suppose that the situation is out of my control my purposes will not be thwarted if pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go well and good if he does not i will fit his resistance into my plans and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that i would have been thrown for a loss if pharaoh had obeyed me to return to the question that started this all off is it possible that the serbs in slaughtering the moslems of bosnia are instruments of god s will first point what they are doing is wrong just as what joseph s brothers did was wrong just as what judas did was wrong they intend it for evil if god somehow brings good out of it that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment second point of course god will bring good out of it but not the same good that he would have brought if the serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder nor does the good he purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right yours james kiefer",1251

month i m the virtual reality market manager for silicon graphics so perhaps i can help a little in article raymond chui writes hello the real reality our agency started to express interest in virtual reality vr so far we do not know much about vr all we know about are the hollywood movies the terminater and lawnmover man we also know something about vr from abc news magazine and computer graphics world magazine unfortunately while sgi systems were used to create the special effects for both terminator and lawnmower man those are film quality computer graphics rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time each frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on high end parallel processing computer systems thus that level of graphics would be difficult if not impossible to acheive in real time frames per second we certainly want to know more about vr who are the leading companies agencies universities what machines support vr i e sgi sun hp bim etc it depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is true immersive visualization vr requires the rendering of complex visual databases at anywhere from to newly rendered frames per second this is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training if the frame rate is too low the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations additionally the frame rate must be constant if the system renders frames per second at one point then frames per second the next perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before the user can get heavily distracted by the medium the graphics computer rather than focusing on the data to maintain a constant frame rate the system must be able to run in real time unix in general does not support real time operation but silicon graphics has modified the unix kernel for its multi processor systems to be able to support real time operation bypassing the usual unix process priority management schemes uniprocessor systems running unix can not fundamentally support real time operation not sun sparc not hp series systems not ibm rs not even sgi s uniprocessor systems like indigo or crimson only our multiprocessor onyx and challenge systems support real time operation due to their symmetric multi processing smp shared memory architecture from a graphics perspective rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real time multi sample anti aliasing of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today only crimson realityengine and onyx realityengine systems fully support these capabilities the anti aliasing is particularly important as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment what kind of graphics languages are used with vr gl opengl phigs pex gks etc you can use

"from joshua mogal subject re sgi sales practices was crimson was kubota announcement organization silicon graphics inc lines nntp posting host deadhead asd sgi com my comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other vendors that supported opengl rather than deal further with sgi opengl is a graphics programming library and as such is a great portable interface for the development of interactive d graphics applications it is not however an indicator of performance as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor sgi is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools so opengl means that you can port easily from sgi to other platforms there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck if your sales representative truly mislead you then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local sgi sales management team feel free to contact the local branch manager we understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers so give it a shot i m also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around for a while rather than being flushed as one of the previous posts stated the personal iris was introduced in and grew to include the d d d and d as clock rates sped up over time as a rule of thumb sgi platforms live for about years this was true of the motorola based series the pi the professional series the early d s the power series parallel systems individual cpu subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about years new graphics architectures at the high end gt vgx realityengine are released every months to years these are the facts of life if we look at these machines they become almost archaic after four years and we have to come out with a new platform like indigo onyx challenge which has higher bus bandwidths faster cpus faster graphics and i o and larger disk capacities if we don t we become uncompetitive from the user perspective you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today you can t wait to buy but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine ask the sales rep for one in writing if it s feasible they should be able to do that some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them such as the performance protection program for older r based power series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new onyx or challenge r based bit multiprocessor systems now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter but i m just a little tired of getting boned in the process if that s happening it s becausing of misunderstandings or mis communication not because sgi is directly attempting to annoy our customer base maybe it s because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we aren t entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa for instance are this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations doesn t have a load of money to spend on computers every year so we can t be out buying new systems on a regular basis most sgi customers are onesy twosey types but regardless we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again like a previous post stated if we pre announced and the schedule slipped we would mess up our potential customers schedules when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond that means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one previous poster s words to fill a niche to compete with some other vendor i m going to be looking at this box for the next five years and every time i look at it i m going to think about sgi and how i could have better spent my money actually your money since we re supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars five years is an awfully long time in computer years new processor technologies are arriving every years making a year old computer at least and probably generations behind the times the competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development so if your timing is really years between purchases you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor there are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with but keeping customers happy is the most important so don t give up we know it josh joshua mogal product manager advanced graphics division advanced

"from kenneth sloan subject re removing distortion from bitmapped drawings organization cis university of alabama at birmingham lines in article earl boebert writes let s say you have a scanned image of a line drawing in this case a boat but it could be anything on the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x y positions are known now you digitize the drawing manually in this case using yaron danon s excellent digitize program that is you use a program which converts cursor positions to x y and saves those values when you click the mouse upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values this is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper errors introduced in the printing process scanner errors and what have you the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing so global adjustments such as stretching contracting uniformly over x or y or rotating the whole drawing are not satisfactory so the question is does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion in particular if i have three sets of points reference x y the known true values distortedreference x y the same points with known errors distorteddata x y other points with unknown errors what function of reference and distorted could i apply to distorteddata to remove the errors i suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy d surface solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove the errors in the other data points it helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion below is a very short description of the process which we use if you have further questions feel free to poke me via e mail assume locally smooth distortion compute the delaunay triangulation of your x y points this defines the set of neighbors for each point if your data are not naturally convex you may have very long edges on the convex hull consider deleting these edges now there are two goals a move the distorteddata x y to the reference x y b keep the length e as measured from the current x y s as close as possible to the digitizedlength e as measured using the digitized x y s for every point compute a displacement based on a and b for example a for x y points for which you know the reference x y you can move alpha reference x y current x y this will slowly move the distortedreference x y towards the reference x y b for all other points examine the current length of each edge for each edge compute a displacement which would make that edge the correct length where correct is the digitizedlength take the vector sum of these edge displacements and move the point alpha sumofedgedisplacements this will keep the triangulated mesh consistent with your digitized mesh iterate until you are happy for example no point moves very much alpha and alpha need to be determined by experimentation consider how much you believe the reference x y i e do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the references or do you want to balance some error in matching the reference against changes in length of the edges warning there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed essentially you can t allow the convex hull to change and you can t allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points or by periodically re triangulating the points using the current positions but still calculating digitizedlength from the original positions when we first did this the triangulation time was prohibitive so we only did it once if i were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for years i might go back and re triangulate on every iteration if you have more compute power than you know what to do with you might consider having every point interact with every other point but first read up on linear solutions to the n body problem there are lots of papers in the last years of siggraph proceedings on springs constraints

"from james felder subject re some thoughts organization nasa lewis resaerch center lines distribution world reply to nntp posting host hopper lerc nasa gov in article dan lawrence bissell writes first i want to start right out and say that i m a christian it makes sense to be one have any of you read tony campollo s book liar lunatic or the real thing i might be a little off on the title but he writes the book anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity in the process he became a christian himself sounds like you are saying he was a part of some conspiracy just what organization did he belong to does it have a name the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy a modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he was logic alert artificial trifercation the are many other possible explainations could have been that he never existed there have been some good points made in this group that is not impossible that jc is an amalgam of a number of different myths mithra comes to mind some reasons why he wouldn t be a liar are as follows who would die for a lie wouldn t people be able to tell if he was a liar people gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed call me a fool but i believe he did heal people logic alert argument from incredulity just because it is hard for you to believe this doesn t mean that it isn t true liars can be very pursuasive just look at koresh that you yourself site he has followers that don t think he is a fake and they have shown that they are willing to die by not giving up after getting shot himself koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes as far as healing goes if i rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels in one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today seems to me that the early gospels weren t that compeling so the stories got bigger to appeal better niether was he a lunatic would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy very doubtful in fact rediculous for example anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away therefore since he wasn t a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing or might not have existed or any number of things that is the logical pitfall that those who use flawed logic like this fall into there are bifurcations or tri quad etc that are valid because in the proceeding steps the person shows conclusively that the alternatives are all that are possible once everyone agrees that the given set is indeed all there are then arguments among the alternatives can be presentent and one mostly likely to be true can be deduced by excluding all other possible alternatives however if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid even if the true choice is one of the original choices i have given at least one valid alternative so the conclusion that jc is the real mccoy just because he isn t one of the other two alternative is no longer valid some other things to note he fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in hrs alone this in his betrayal and crucifixion i don t have my bible with me at this moment next time i write i will use it jc was a rabbi he knew what those prophecies were it wouldn t be any great shakes to make sure one does a list of actions that would fullfill prophecy what would be compeling is if there were a set of clear and explicit prophecies and jc had absolutely no knowledge of then yet fullfilled them anyway i don t think most people understand what a christian is it is certainly not what i see a lot in churches rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for god s sake he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the same hey we can t do it god himself inspires us to turn our lives over to him that s tuff and most people don t want to do it to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at but just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes time we don t rush it in one day christianity is your whole life it is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a while we box everything into time units such as work at this time sports tv social life god is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ourselves here i agree with you anyone who buys into this load of mythology should take what it says seriously and what it says is that it must be a total way of life i have very little respect for

"from robin coutellier subject critique of pressure point massager originator nntp posting host volans reply to robin coutellier organization northern telecom inc mountain view ca distribution na lines as promised below is a personal critique of a pressure point massager i recently bought from the self care catalog i am very pleased with the results the catalog description is as follows the pressure point massager is an aggressive physical massager that actually kneads the tension out of muscles much like a professional shiatsu masseur the powerful motor drives two counter rotating thumbs that move in one inch orbits releasing tension in the neck back legs and arms pressure point massager a to order or receive a catalog call hours days or fax at note when i ordered the massager the item number was different and the price was not when i received it i glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one i was quite annoyed to see a difference in price i called them about it and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers although it looks and works exactly the same he told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one using the price difference as a reason for return in fact since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory i received this one in days he told me i could use the one i already have until the new one arrives then return the old one very reasonable people i have long term neck shoulder and back pain if i were a building i would be described as structurally unsound i have stretches and exercises to do that help but the problem never really goes away if for whatever reason i do not exercise for a while illness not enough time lazy etc the muscles become quite stiff and painful and thus more prone to further strain even with exercise i sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track which st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for p t the tension in my neck if not released eventually causes a headache sometimes confused with a sinus headache over my left eye when my physical therapist has massaged my neck and the sub occipital muscles in particular the knobby areas near the base of the skull the headache usually eased within a day although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged i ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what i was wishing someone would invent a machine that would massage not vibrate my neck and sub occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past that i could use by myself no doctor visit or inconvenient p t appts for a week later would be needed to use it i could get up in the middle of the night and use it if necessary i have been using it for about a week or so now and love it the base unit is about a x rectangle about high with handles on each side and it plugs into an average outlet the two metal thumbs are about in diameter and protrude about above the base the thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non removable they are located more toward one end rather than centered see figure below they move in either clockwise or counter clockwise directions depending on which side of the switch is pushed and are very quiet it can be used from either side for instance the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck depending on which direction you approach it _______________________________ __ _______________ __ _______________ __ __ _______________________________ for the neck head the user varies the amount of pressure used by if laying down allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and or neck to rest on the thumbs the handles can also be used if sitting or standing applying pressure with the arms wrists since my wrists are also impaired i m typing this over an extended period of time and i don t have someone living with me who can apply it laying down works well for me for my back i sit in a high backed kitchen chair position the massager behind me at whatever point i want massaged and lean back lightly or not so lightly against it the pressure of leaning back holds it in place if i want to massage the entire spine i simply move it down a few inches whenever i feel like it for my back this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used home made massager of tennis balls taped together with the balls position against a wall or door them over the spine and move the body up and down against them the tennis balls are better than nothing but difficult to use for very long especially if your quads are not in good shape and my long hair gets painfully in the way if i don t pin it up first as far as i m concerned the easier something like this is to use the more likely i ll use do it if there are multiple considerations hassles i m more likely to not bother with it not only has this machine helped with my headaches but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased the first time i used it on my neck sub occipital muscles however i overdid it and pressed too hard against it which resulted in a very tender almost bruised area for a few days i laid off it for about days and applied ice which helped after that i was more gradual about applying pressure at this point the pain in the sub occipital area is now minimal while being massaged i also learned to use very light pressure on my lower back which is the most vulnerable point for me it also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades although again it took a few days of massaging just a few minutes at a time to really work it out i highly recommend this product if you have similar problems although i can not vouch for its durability it seems pretty sturdy since i ve had it such a short time i plan to use it not only to ease tension but also to loosen the muscls before exercising and maybe after too i have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks so this was very timely for me this is the st product i ve ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co worker the catalog states they have been in business since it contains quite a few health care products and while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do definitely a step above some other ones i ve seen such as dr leonards health care catalog or mature wisdom i m only but have ended up on some geriatric type

sirach is more directly referenced by james than _job_ or _ruth_ is referenced in any nt verse i ve seen good point the new testament does not quote ezra nehemiah esther ruth job ecclesiastes or song of songs just as it does not quote from the deuterocanon but if the non quotation of the former does not disqualify them neither does the non quotation of the later and the wisodm of solomon was quite clearly an influence on st paul especially in the letter to the romans cf especially romans and wisdom stuff deleted i think everyone would agree that principles that can not be consistently applied are not very useful as principles so if we are to exclude them not accord them the authority of scripture we would appear to require other reasons what might these reasons be tradition always a fav with episcop tradition is equivocal on this subject sirach i believe is in vaticanus sinaiticus i don t know if it is listed in the muratorian canon the oldest list i know of sirach and the others are discussed by the fathers as scripture but not unanimously true not all accepted them as scripture though niether were all the books of the new testament so accepted which puts to the lie the whole argument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not universally accepted hebrews the apocalypse peter esther and others were debated at various times but eventually retained as for the codexes you mention both vaticanus and sinaitcus include the deuterocanon bothe of the new and old testaments and vaticanus i think inlcudes clement the shepard of hermas and the epistle of baranabas as for the muratorian canon it deals with the new testament only though it is very valuable in its witness to those books my interim conclusion is that protestant exclusion of at least one of these writings is one of those traditions of men one hears of so often they were excluded during the reformation and that appears to be the reason many people continue to exclude them any takers i can be reasonable if all else fails show me where i m wrong you re not wrong it is a tradition of men to exlcude them as i will explain below that nothing be read in the church under the nmae of divine scripture except the canonical scriptures and the canoncial scriptures are genesis exodus leviticus numbers deuteronomy joshua judges ruth four books of kingdoms being samuel and kings two books of paralpomenon being chronicles job the psalter of david the five books of solomon being proverbs ecclesiastes song of songs wisdom of solomon and misatributed to him the wisdom of jesus son of sirach the books of the twelve minor prophets isaiah jeremiah being jeremiah the lamentations baruch and the letter all of which were formerly counted as one ezekiel daniel tobit judith esther two books of ezra being ezra and nehemiah two books of maccabees and of the new testament four books of the gospel one book of the acts of the apostles thirteen letters of paul the apostle one letter of the same to the hebrews two of peter the apostle three of john one of the apostle jude one of the apostle james one book of the apocalypse of john council of hippo statute ad this same list was promulgated again at the third council of carthage ad and at the sixth council of carthage ad at which council the same list was enumerated with the words because we have recieved from the fathers that these are the books to be read in the church which ought to quiet those who assert in the name of holy scripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was never any doubt in the church as the episcopal church does in removing the deuterocanon from the realm of scripture though the episcopalians hold them in high regard and read them in the church they are not counted as scripture by them and may not be used to prove dogma the lutherans hold out similarly earlier mention of the so called apocrypha as divine scripture can also be found and below i inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it divine scripture that could be found among the writings of the fathers and this is the reason why the law of the old testament is reckoned as consisting of twenty two books so that they may correspond to the number of letters in the hebrew alphabet it is to be noted also that by adding to these tobias and judith there are twenty four books corresponding to the number of letters used by the greeks st hillary of poitiers commentaries on the psalms prologue ad the twenty two books according to the hebrews are jeremiah with lamentations and the letter reckoned as one and also there is maccabees origen commentaries on the psalms psalm ad divine scripture addressing itself to those who love themselves and to the boastful says most excellently baruch follows st clement of alexandria the instuctor of children ad i learned accurately the books of the old testament proverbs of solomon and also wisdom st melito of sardes fragment found in eusebius history of the church and dating from crica ad book it is likewise decreed now indeed we must treat of the divine scriptures what the universal catholic church accepts and what she must shun the list of the old testament wisdom one book ecclesiasticus one book tobit one book judith one book of maccabees two books st damasus i pope the decree of damsus section ad i would think this enough though more can be shown that the church has always accepted the deutero canon though parts have been disputed by various persons for if disputes involving the new testament deutero canon does not disqulaify those books i e hebrews james peter john jude revelation in protestant eyes than neither should it disqulaify the old testament books and i must point out that the jews only drew up their canon in ad years after the founding of the christian religion upon the cross why should we adhere to a canon that was drawn up by the faithless in reaction to the chrsitian use of the greek septuagint which includes the deutero canon as early as ad st justin had already accused the jews of mutilating the canon of scripture by their removal of certain books protestants apparently prefer to think that god s revelation was limited by a decree of the jews in the ordering of their the jews faithless canon and that he could not use other people like the apostles in drawing up the canon the apostles were most certain users of the septuagint as some of the old testament quotes use the wording of the septuagint and not the hebrew and the septuagint includes the deuterocanon",1363

state epidemiologist colorado dept of health jm douglas md denver dept of health and hospitals surveillance and information systems br div of sexually transmitted diseases and hiv prevention national

stimulated by visitations to laboratories by cdh surveillance staff during the increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at dmhc and in culture positivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact however the stable culture positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory which serves a network of clinics statewide indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population one possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado may be gang and drug related sexual behavior as implicated in a recent outbreak of drug resistant gonorrhea and other stds in colorado springs although the high morbidity census tracts in the denver metropolitan area coincide with areas of gang and drug activity this hypothesis requires further assessment to examine the possible role of drug use implicated previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis the cdh std aids program is collecting information from all persons in whom gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use exchange of sex for money or drugs and gang affiliation the gonorrhea rate for blacks in colorado substantially exceeds the national health objective for the year per objective a race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other stds risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at greatest risk for stds and for targeting prevention efforts moreover race specific variation in std rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status access to medical care and high risk behaviors in response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado interventions initiated by the cdh std aids program include targeting partner

children less than years of age selected states and source mmwr date apr motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and young adults in the united states and account for more than million years of potential life lost before age annually child safety seats and safety belts can substantially reduce this loss from through all states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety belts for children although these laws reduce injuries to young children by an estimated motor vehicle crash related injuries remain a major cause of disability and death among u s children while the use of occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age usage for those aged years aged years and aged years in addition parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to use restraints for their children to characterize the association between adult safety belt use and adult reported consistent use of occupant restraints for the youngest child aged less than years within a household cdc analyzed data obtained from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system brfss during and this report summarizes the findings from this study data were available for respondents aged greater than or equal to years in states that participated in brfss a population based random digit dialed telephone survey and administered a standard injury control and child safety module developed by cdc of these respondents had a child aged less than years in their household each respondent was asked to specify the child s age and the frequency of restraint use for that child the two categories of child restraint and adult safety belt use in this analysis were consistent use i e always buckle up and less than consistent use i e almost always sometimes rarely or never buckle up data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state software for survey data analysis sudaan was used to calculate point estimates and confidence

significantly higher p less than chi square test in law states than in no law states versus and versus respectively high rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than consistent safety belt use figure adults with consistent use reported high rates of child occupant restraint use regardless of the child s age range for year olds to for year olds in comparison for adults reporting less than consistent safety belt use the rate of child occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child range for year olds to for year olds when comparing children of consistent adult safety belt users with children of less than consistent adult safety belt users confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age groups i e aged less than and year reported child occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded that in no law states regardless of age of child table in addition higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with increased restraint use for children a factor that has also been associated with increased adult safety belt use reported by national center for injury prevention and control national center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion cdc editorial note the findings in this report are consistent with others indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to employ occupant restraints for their children because these nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit other risk taking behaviors children traveling with them may be at greater risk for motor vehicle injury educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with child restraint use in this report accordingly occupant protection programs should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment because low educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status such programs should be offered to adults through health care facilities that serve low income communities or through federal programs i e head start that are directed at parents with young children injury prevention programs emphasize restraining young children in addition however efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april they become older parents especially those with low educational attainment those who do not consistently wear safety belts and those from states that do not have mandatory safety belt use laws should be encouraged to wear safety belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and safety belts finally the increased use of restraints among children may increase their

years description of system the california birth defects monitoring program and the metropolitan atlanta congenital defects program are two population based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods the prevalence estimates for diagnostic categories were based on data for for births in california and births in metropolitan atlanta the prevalences in the two areas were compared adjusting for race sex and maternal age by using poisson regression results regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis fetal alcohol syndrome hip dislocation dysplasia microcephalus obstruction of the kidney ureter and scoliosis lordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability however differences in the prevalences of arm hand limb reduction encephalocele spina bifida or trisomy down syndrome are probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment because these defects are relatively easy to diagnose interpretation regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalences of trisomy and spina bifida however the reason for differences in arm hand reduction is unknown but may be related to variability in environmental exposure heterogeneity in the gene pool or random variation actions taken because of the similarities of these data bases several collaborative studies are being implemented in particular the differences in the birth prevalence of spina bifida and down syndrome will focus attention on the impact of prenatal diagnosis authors jane schulman ph d nancy hicnet

identification of influenza viruses weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and territorial epidemiologists and from sentinel family practice physicians nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received throughout the year results during the influenza season influenza a hn and b viruses were identified in the united states with essentially equal frequency overall although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted over the course of the season throughout the season increases in the indices of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza a hn predominated were similar to increases in regions where influenza b predominated only of identified viruses were influenza a hn but isolations of this subtype increased as the season waned and it subsequently predominated during the season during the season outbreaks in nursing homes were reported in association with influenza b and a hn but not influenza a hn interpretation the alternating temporal and geographic predominance of influenza strains a hn and b during the season emphasizes the importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance since amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza a actions taken weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced throughout the season allow physicians and public health

embryo transfer ivf et baby in a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been developed that include ivf et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer gift embryo cryopreservation freezing and gamete micromanipulation together these technologies are referred to as the high tech assisted reproductive technology art procedures ovulation induction sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and or pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility management however when these fail it almost always is appropriate to proceed with one of the art procedures therefore in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility service at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility there is a program of assisted reproduction that specializes in art procedures this program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients in the state of arizona whose infertility problems can not be resolved by the traditional therapies the following article on back describes the art procedures available in our center clarifies appropriate applications for each and considers the realistic expectations for their success procedures included are o in vitro o fertilization embryo transfer ivf et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer o gift cryopreservation of human embryos and gamete micromanipulation this article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed towards improved success of these technologies hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april future areas of research in addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the management of infertile couples we are developing the technology to assist couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary disease this technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either dna amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization there are recent reports of the successful application of dna amplification by other centers for example for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia we hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probing the x chromosome the identification of which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit sex linked disorders the considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis in addition to the possibility of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses in order to avoid the birth of affected children catherine racowsky ph d associate professor and director of research department of obstetrics and gynecology college of medicine university of arizona tucson arizona applications success rates and advances for the management of infertility the following are the art procedures available at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility in vitro fertilization embryo transfer is the core art procedure of our assisted reproduction program this procedure involves retrieval of unfertilized eggs from the ovary their insemination in vitro in a dish and the culture of resultant embryos for or days before they are transferred to the patient s uterus all cultures are maintained in an incubator under strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions before being processed for use in insemination semen samples are evaluated in our andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april assisted semen analyses to ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to perform ivf et or indeed gift follicular development is typically stimulated with gonadotropins perganol metrodin gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh factrel lutrepulse and or gnrh analogues lupron depo lupron synarel occasionally however ivf et is accomplished with eggs obtained in non stimulated cycles while some programs utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound guided retrieval in our infertility unit with the patient sedated couples who resort to ivf et exhibit such pathologies as tubal deficiencies ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis and or mild forms of male factor infertility according to the united states ivf registry the overall success rate for ivf et nationwide has stabilized at about percent per cycle results from our program involving patients who have undergone ivf et cycles reflect a comparable success rate nevertheless the overall incidence of success with this procedure is disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies well recognized predictors of outcome include patient age response to exogenous ovarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeated ivf et cycle attempts however among these age is the single most significant determinant of conception therefore it is critical that such patients are referred to an assisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity following failure of traditional therapies the underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not been clearly delineated beyond recognition that the number of eggs available for retrieval declines markedly with age fertilization rates significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over years and provided the appropriate hormonal background is present age is unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy ongoing research in our center therefore is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may be impacted by age we have determined that more than percent of eggs that fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal and that a significant proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age currently the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor our program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy gift this high tech art procedure is performed in the operating room usually with the use of a laparoscope and in contrast to ivf et involves introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the fallopian tube an average of eggs tube under these circumstances fertilization occurs in vivo and if excess eggs are retrieved the remainder undergo ivf with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle or freezing for transfer in a subsequent cycle this art procedure is applied to cases in hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april which there is at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple has such pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis male factor infertility and or idiopathic infertility the data reported in the united states ivf registry for through indicate that the overall success rate with gift is higher than that obtained with the ivf et technique range of clinical pregnancies for gift is to percent and for ivf et to percent in view of this fact one might expect more patients to be treated with gift than ivf et however in our program we have taken into account three basic concerns which while substantially reducing the number of gift cycles performed benefit the patient these concerns are the increased costs associated with performing a procedure in the operating room the risks albeit minimal of undergoing general anesthesia and the considerable benefits to be accrued from obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs and the developmental competency of resultant embryos the increased success with gift undoubtedly reflects the artificial environment provided by the laboratory in the ivf et procedure between january and december we have performed a total of gift cycles with an overall success rate of percent embryo cryopreservation or freezing is applied in our program when embryos result from residual gift eggs or from non transferred ivf embryos this procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for success at much reduced costs but also circumvents the legal and ethical issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos therefore as stipulated by the american fertility society ethical guidelines for art programs from both a practical and an ethical standpoint all assisted reproduction programs should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys gamete micromanipulation this art procedure which is still very new is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility less than million sperm ml in combination with fewer than perccent motile sperm and or less than percent sperm with normal morphology we are currently developing the procedure of sub zonal insertion szi which entails injecting sperm under the coating around the egg the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm through enzymatic digestion available data from szi programs world wide indicate that only to percent of szi cycles result in a pregnancy this statistic undoubtedly relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm therefore we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation such efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to establish conception catherine racowsky ph d hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april associate professor and director of research department of obstetrics and gynecology college of medicine

material i haven t been particularly careful in the past about saving attributions i think the following comes from john a johnson but someone correct me if i m wrong this is probably the longest of my entire collection ________________________________________________________ so that the prophecy be fulfilled in considering the christian religion and judging it according to its claims it is important to look at its claims at fulfilling earlier jewish prophecy the scribe matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of jesus of nazareth as you will see matthew s main strategy is to take various old testament passages often not even about the promised messiah and apply them to the circumstances in the new testament we must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts since the gospels were written at least years after jesus was executed we do not know how much happened exactly as stated but for purposes of analysis we will take particular claims at face value immanuel we begin of course at the beginning mt mary will bear a son and you joseph will name him jesus which means g d is salvation for he will save his people from their sins all this happened to fulfil what the lord had spoken by a prophet isaiah in the days of ahaz c bce king of judah rezin of syria and pekah of israel made war on jerusalem capitol of judah but could not quite conquer it when the house of david i e ahaz and his court in judah were told of this its heart and the heart of its people shook and the lord g d said to isaiah go to meet with ahaz and the lord spoke to ahaz through prophet isaiah naturally saying ask a sign of g d your lord it can be as deep as sheol or as high as heaven but ahaz said i won t ask i will not put the lord to a test then isaiah said hear then o house of david is it not enough for you to weary men that you must weary my god too therefore the lord himself will give you a sign behold a young woman is with child and will bear a son and name him immanuel which means g d is with us he will eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil and choose good for before the child knows how to refuse evil and choose good the land of the two kings you dread will have been deserted matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics further he the hebrew word almah young woman as specifically virgin but this is not a prophecy about the messiah it is not a prophecy about an event to happen years later it is not a prophecy about a virgin bethulah mother in short it not about jesus matthew has made use of a verse out of context and tries to make it fit the specific case of mary it should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner a very general one it can be made to fit mary mary virgin or not was indeed a young woman with child of course the fit is shady and has problems jesus while thought of by later christians to be g d walking among men was never called by the name immanuel if christianity wished to claim this prophecy for jesus it becomes at best a cut and paste prophecy a second class prophecy not too convincing egypt after jesus s birth in bethlehem matthew tells about a quick and elsewhere unmentioned excursion to egypt as if he wishes to liken jesus to moses this was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king herod mt and remained there until the death of herod this was to fulfil what the lord had spoken out of egypt i have cal led my son what the lord really said was this hosea when israel was a child i loved him and out of egypt i called my son the more i called them my people the more they went from me they kept sacrificing to the ba als and kept burning incense to idols matthew conveniently omits the rest of hosea s oracle but it was indeed israel that once called out of egypt wanted to return this is history jesus is certainly not being spoken of here and if we are to draw some kind of parallel here we wind up with a jesus that flees and resists g d again this prophecy is just not as convincing as matthew probably had hoped rachel weeps while jesus is off vacationing in egypt matthew says that king herod sought to kill him and thus ordered the executions of all young male children matthew then writes mt by this that which was spoken by the prophet jeremiah was fulfilled a voice was heard in ramah wailing and loud lamentation rachel weeping for her children she refused to be consoled because they were no more the reference is to a passage in jeremiah referring to the carrying off of israel into exile by sargon of assyria in bce rachel the ancestor of the major tribes of israel ephraim and manasseh is said to weep for her descendants who are no more it is metaphorical of course since rachel lived and dies before the hebrews were even in the egyptian exile it is interesting to note that it was leah not rachel who was the ancestor of the judeans the land where jesus and bethlehem were if anyone should do weeping for her children it is leah the only connexion that rachel has with bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city on the way to ephrath bethlehem as for herod and his infanticide it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred one never knows but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the bible nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time herod was particularly unliked in his reign and many far less evil deeds of herod were carefully recorded this might be a prime example of how events were added to jesus s life to enhance the message of the church s gospel because of the whole story s similarity to the tale of the infant moses in egypt it is highly likely that it is a device set up by matthew to add prophetic yet artificial approval of jesus it is not surprising that matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the jeremiah quote the children the prophet speaks of are not dead but exiled in the assyrian empire g d comforts the weeping rachel saying that the children will be returned he will gather them back together of course this would not suit matthew s purpose as the children he speaks of are dead for good again the prophecy matthew sets up is not even that and to anyone who bothers to check it out is not too convincing the nazarene we do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another matthean prophecy after leaving egypt joseph wife take the infant jesus to live in the city of nazareth mt that what was spoken of by the prophets might be fulfilled he shall be called a nazarene first thing we notice is that matthew does not mention the name of the prophet s this time second we have to ask who he is there are no messianic prophecies speaking of a nazarene worse there are no prophecies period mentioning a nazarene still worse there are no nazarenes mentioned in the old testament at all in the book of judges an angel tells samson s mother that she will judges conceive and bear a son no razor shall tough his head for he will be a nazirite to his god from the day of his birth he will deliver israel from the hands of the philistines this is of course not a prophecy of jesus or the messiah of g d but it is the best that can be found obviously matthew has begun to go overboard in cut and paste prophecies in that he is simple making them up now bearing our diseases jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities mt this was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet isaiah he took our infirmities and bore our diseases as expected the verse quoted in isaiah is quoted out of context and a few words are skewed to fit the christian scheme we have is surely he the suffering servant has borne our sickness and carried our pains from a reading of the surrounding passages in isaiah we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of israel jehovah s chosen servant and people he speaks to the israelites suffering in exile in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it this image is deeply ingrained in jewish identity an image of a chastised yet cherished israel as the instrument of the nations salvation by g d the verses speak of israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline they do not speak of a servant going around and healing people notice that the servant in isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations and individual jews jesus as we all know did not take the diseases onto himself the verses here in isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come but rather something that had already happened while it is believed that jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell he did not bear the illnesses he healed so while someone might want to say that figuratively jesus reenacted the deeds of israel in his spiritual atonement he has to admit that matthew s parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect silent messiah upon healing multitudes of commoners it is said that jesus ordered them to keep quiet presumable so that he wouldn t arouse the attention of the local rulers mt this was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet isaiah behold my servant whom i have chosen my beloved with whom my soul is pleased i will put my spirit on him and he will announce justice to the gentiles he will not wrangle or cry aloud nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets he will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings justice to victory and the gentiles will hope in his name the isaiah passage quoted reads is behold my servant whom i uphold my chosen in whom my soul delights i have put my spirit on him and he will bring forth justice to the nations we will not cry or lift up his voice or make it heard in the street he will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick he will faithfully bring forth justice he will not fail burn dimly or be discouraged bruised until he has established justice in the earth and the coastlands await his law you see matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage because it does not suit the dealings of jesus christians could never think of jesus failing never would the light of mankind burn dimly but the servant nation of israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done when the gentiles come to embrace g d there will no longer be a chosen people but rather all will be the children of g d also the ending phrase has been changed from the judaic the coastlands await his law to the christologic the gentiles will hope in his name while the original proclaims the torah law of jehovah the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of believing in the name if one has any doubt the servant referred to is not jesus one has only to read the whole chapter isaiah and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant a people robbed and plundered so we see that when matthew s attempt at prophecy is examined it crumbles three days and three nights now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god jesus himself he speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection mt for as jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights so will the son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights before any further discussion can occur it is necessary to know how the jews understood days as far as day names went each was hours long lasting from sunset pm to the following sunset pm what was referred to as a day was the period of light from am to the ending sunset at pm thus according to our time scale a sabbath day began at pm friday evening and lasted until pm saturday evening this is why the jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of saturdays instead of sundays it seems like a real miracle that christians didn t forget that saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week thus when days and nights are referred to together hour daylight portions and hour night periods are being spoken of thus jesus says that he will be in the grave or in hell or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights as the good book tells us jesus was crucified on the ninth hour which is pm friday afternoon he then was put into the grave sometime after that then jesus left the grave rose before dawn of what we call sunday the dawn after the sabbath was over what this means is that jesus was using our time for clarity in the grave from pm friday night to some time before am sunday morning we could also add a little time before pm friday since the bible is not specific here what this means using jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day two nights and possibly a couple of hours of one day certainly this is a problem for jesus prediction there is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights even using modern time measurements we then are led to suspect that this error is another one of matthew s little mistakes and that the gospel writer put false words into his god s mouth and no matter who made the prediction it is more than unconvincing it is counter convincing hearing understanding jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables stories in which a deeper meaning could be found if you were already one of the elect those chosen to understand the message of jesus he reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants if the people can not understand them there is no need to bother with them since they will not accept the plain message any better matthew says mt with them the audience indeed in fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah which says you will indeed hear but never understand and you will indeed see but never perceive because this people s heart has grown dull their ears are heavy of hearing and they have shut their eyes so the they would not perceive with them her with their ears and understand with their heart and turn for me to heal them the original isaiah passages are part of his earlier works his call to the ministry this is in bce when israel is flourishing right before it falls under the authority of assyria isaiah sees the good times ending and also a vision from g d calling him to bring reform to israel and judah is and g d said go and say to this people hear and hear but do not understand see and see but do not perceive make the heart of this people fat make their ears heavy and shut their eyes so they will not see with their eyes or hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and turn and be healed then isaiah said how long lord and he said until the cities lie waste without inhabitant and houses without men and the land is utterly desolate and the g ds take men far away and forsaken places are many in the land and though a tenth will remain in it it will be burned again like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still stands when the tree is felled the holy seed is its stump here we see that it is really g d who causes the people of israel to stop listening to the prophet s warnings but reaffirms the promise made to solomon s and david s seed lineage if you read the rest of isaiah you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of g d to use israel as a servant a light to the nations look at isaiah we see that matthew has cut and pasted just a little portion of isaiah s verse to suit his own gospel needs more than that he has altered the words to make it fit the people who didn t understand jesus s stories and as we see isaiah s verses are not prophecies but rather commands from g d to him in the present once again matthew s prophecy falls flat on its face matthew tries again to make jesus s parables look like they have the prophetic approval mt he said nothing to them without a parable this was to fulfil what was spoken of by the prophet i will open my mouth to them in parables i will utter that which has been hidden since the foundation of the world matthew really botches up here he attempts to quote not from a prophet but from the psalms ps i will open my mouth in parable i will utter dark sayings of old things that we all have heard and known things that our fathers have told us we will not hide them from their children but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the lord as was pointed out the verses in the psalms do not really come from a prophet you might also want to know that earlier copies of matthew s gospel even inserted isaiah s name as this prophet apparently later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up perhaps the most significant part of this is that once again matthew has altered the old testament scriptures as jesus has said earlier he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them the parables in the psalms are not to be hidden further they speak of things known that our fathers have told us jesus deals with things hidden since the foundation of the world indeed jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion this is in direct opposition to the parables in the psalms no wonder matthew had to rewrite them and still once again matthew s artificial prophecies fall flat on their face but christians rarely look at this matthew s prophecies aren t the only things about christianity that are beginning to look bad excuses of little faith in mt we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons except in one case not knowing what epilepsy was the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons it is no wonder that the disciples were unable to dispossess the epileptic but jesus perhaps no more enlightened than they is reported to have rebuked them saying they didn t have enough faith this seems strange why was this demon special it seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not apparently enough faith will allow someone to move mountains of course you will find no one these days that can move real mountains no one parts seas the only miracles the charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to mexico or some faraway place major miracles are making some old woman s arthritis feel better on sunday morning t v and the gods including jesus are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts they are either dead sleeping or hiding in heaven with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone yet life goes on tales of mystics stories of miracles all in a distant time or a distant place gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days jehovah too but now they are silent all the theologians give are various excuses as to why we don t get to see god anymore we re too lazy we re not zealous enough we re sinful it s just his plan we put too many of our own demands on g d s appearance if we had the right faith if we were willing to meet g d on his terms yet even the most pious of men have not seen g d you dear reader have not seen g d not literally you know that to be true i know that s presumptuous and bold but searching your heart you know what i mean all that we ve seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing g d they say our little faith does not merit us to see g d sometimes they say see the love in these people you worship with see the lives of people change that is seeing g d thus people get lulled to sleep satisfied with turning g d into the everyday sights but that is not seeing g d as i am speaking of it is not seeing g d the way people used to see what we see in the world that is good is the compassion of human hearts the love given and taken by men and women the forgiveness practised by christian atheist alike beauty created by the mind of man these are the things that are done these are what we see but it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith jesus rides on an ass shortly after accepting the role of the jewish messiah king jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into jerusalem mt this took place to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet saying tell the daughter of zion behold your king is coming to you humble mounted on an ass and on a ass colt of course the passage quoted from zechariah reads a little differently lo your king comes to you he is triumphant and victorious humble and riding on an ass on an ass colt he will command peace to the nations there isn t all that much difference here except that zechariah only involves one animal an ass colt while matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently thus he has jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass from matthew s version we get a comical picture of the divine christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys this could inevitably lead to a theological proctological dilemma we find that in the account written earlier by st mark only the colt was called for and brought to jesus this indeed fits the verses of zechariah properly and shows us that in matthew attempt to use prophetic verses he has bungled now excluding many respectable christians i have met i have noticed that while christ is thought to have ridden on asses the situation is often reversed nowadays then entering the jerusalem temple the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling jesus the messiah but jesus replied as we might expect matthew to have done mt haven t you read out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise it is more likely that matthew made this response up since jesus was never one to point out such little prophetic things and since as we might expect the quote is in error which seems to fit matthew s track record quite well we might ask jesus or matthew haven t you read for the source reads psalms o yahweh our lord how majestic is your name in the whole world you whose glory is chanted above the heavens by babes and infants you have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the enemy and the avenger the passages hardly need comment there is no perfect praise spoken of in the psalm and what praise is there is given to g d not his messiah king and not jesus as mentioned it seems to be just one more case of matthew s pen making up convenient prophetic scripture yhvh said to my lord jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised jewish messiah king is to be descended the jews agree it is king david but then jesus counters by quoting psalms the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemies under your feet taken at face value jesus is denying the necessity of davidic descent one assumes he is in opposition to their answer of course the christian answer is that he agrees but is trying to make some hidden point to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah king it s tempting to believe this if one is a christian and not interested in matters of investigation but there are problems in jesus s time the psalm was thought to be about the messiah and it is easy to see why david might refer to the messiah as his superior we need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king bringing the jews to times even better than those under david s rule of course the jews listening had no good answer and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah such as the christians worship the problem lies in the meaning of this psalm an error that apparently several jews of jesus s time had also made one must remember that there were various factions among the jews often as a result of different expectations of the messiah king jesus was apparently one of these adventists like his audience who thought the messiah s advent was imminent and who interpreted psalms among others as being messianic what is the problem then psalm literally reads yhvh s utterance to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies your footstool yhvh sends forth your mighty scepter from zion rule in the midst of your foes your people will offer themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the holy mountains you are a priest of the order of melchizedek forever the word lord is often mistakenly capitalised by christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord but in the hebrew the word is adoni and no capitalisation exists adoni simply means lord a generic term as we would use it it is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to g d it is merely an address of respect there is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah king that this is supposed to be written by david is not certain the title of the psalm translates to either a psalm of david or a psalm about david it seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet about david s covenant and endorsement from g d if the psalm had been written by david it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah the idea of a perfect king descended from david was not present in david s age we have extensive tales of david s doings and sayings none of which include any praises of a messiah many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after david was dead in times of the exile when g d had put his show of favour for david s kingdom on hold the description in the psalm fit david very well david was promised by g d a rise to power victory over his enemies successful judgement among the nations he conquered he achieved the priesthood common to melchizedek in being a righteous king enabled to bless the people it all fits we do not have to blame this problem on matthew alone though here there is not artificial prophecy alluded to though his use of the scripture is rather questionable still this event is common to the other gospels too so we let matthew off a little more easily this time it is interesting to note though how matthew dresses up the event the earlier gospel of mark tells the tale with jesus simply speaking to a crowd matthew has the pharisees who became the religious competition of an infant christianity be the target of jesus s question as we might expect matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the pharisees such power is the pen moses jesus had it together all along we leave the gospel story of matthew momentarily to see a pseudo prophecy in john s gospel the gospel story of john deserves special treatment because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of jesus s career as told by even matthew but for the moment we will just look at one verse the early church leaders founded a religion on the jewish hopes of a messiah king and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by g d when constructing the history of abraham moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the jewish people while this was accomplished eventually under the rule of king david the christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise but to do so they expanded on the promise preaching about a heavenly kingdom john j c speaking your father abraham rejoiced to see my day he say it and was glad it would be nice to tie in approval for jesus from abraham but abraham knew nothing of jesus or a messiah or anything christian i have tried and failed to find any event in the old testament which corresponds to john s little prophecy it is par for the course to see st john making up old testament backings just like his forerunner matthew many christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud and it is surprising they still cling to it the potter s field we are told that jesus was betrayed while in jerusalem by one of his followers judas iscariot matthew writes mt and throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple judas departed but the chief priests taking the silver said it isn t lawful for us to put it in the treasury since it is blood money so they bought a potter s field with it to bury strangers in then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet jeremiah and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of israel and they gave them for the potter s field as the lord directed me this prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of old testament scripture first matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet it is zechariah who utters the verses which matthew makes use of zech and they weighed out my wages thirty shekels of silver then yhvh said to me cast them to the treasury the lordly price at which i was paid off by them so i took the thirty shekels of silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of yhvh first of all the verses of zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah or of g d the deal with a shepherd most likely a priest chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before g d would send judah and israel into conflict with one another the word treasury had been replaced by the king james scholars with to the potter precisely because this made matthew s quote fit better but this is a blatant error the correct translation of the hebrew is indeed treasury which also makes perfect sense in zechariah s context whereas potter s field is totally unrelated whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation however given matthew s track record one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty of course matthew would have ample reason for altering the text the thirty pieces of silver match judas s situation and if as most christians seem to be the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity matthew might have another prophecy to toss around however the correct translation of zechariah directly contradicts the situation with judas and the high priests the high priests would not put the money in the treasury the worthless shepherd of zechariah does exactly the opposite of course to the average thursday night bible student the prophecy as presented by matthew would be taken at new testament face value to those matthew s work is convincing enough wine vinegar casting lots then jesus is led away to be crucified mt they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall but when he tasted it he would not drink it and when they had crucified him they divided his garments among them by casting lots that it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet they parted my garments among them and upon my vesture did they cast lots first of all the vinegar offered to jesus is actually common sour wine of the type that roman soldiers drank regularly we find that right before jesus dies the soldiers themselves give him some to drink not polluted with gall jn jesus said i thirst a bowl of vinegar stood there so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth when he had received the vinegar he said it is finished but matthew seems to be drawing on not a passage from the prophets but one from the psalms ps i looked for pity but there was none and for comforters but i found none they gave me poison for food lit they put gall in my meat and for my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink add to them punishment upon punishment may they have no acquittal from thee let them be blotted out of the book of the living of course the sour wine offered to jesus is done at his request of drink this does indeed seem to be a show of pity the psalm quoted is about david and his political and military enemies it is not about the messiah or jesus it is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the jesus in the psalm asks g d for the damnation of the crucifiers whereas the jesus of the gospels says lk jesus said father forgive them the don t know what they do further matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall a bitter substance put into jesus s drink not his meat as the psalm stipulates with the prophecy of the vinegar faulty we naturally ask what of the casting of lots this brings up the nd psalm which deserves discussion all by itself suffice it now to say that the fact that jesus s clothes were divided as told is no great thing it turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days as we will soon see it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to jesus it does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of jesus s clothes for a man so removed from worldly possessions his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions the nd psalm this psalm is attributed to david as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies it becomes a song of praise to yhvh and of hope taken out of context parts of it seem to fit the plight of jesus at the crucifixion quite well we will examine the primary passages verse my god my god why have you forsaken me why are you so far from helping me far from the words of my groaning oh my god i cry by day but you don t answer and by night but find no rest jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross this suggests that the whole psalm is really about jesus rather than king david of course the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to jesus or his execution jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal he is supposed to be like the lamb led mute before its shearers indeed jesus doesn t do much groaning even when on the cross he certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross but i am a worm and no man scorned by men all who see me mock at me they make faces and wag their heads he committed his cause to yhvh so let him deliver him for he delights in him this seems to fit jesus s execution pretty well with the exception of the holy messiah being called a worm many bulls encompass me they open their mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion yea dogs are round about me a company of evildoers encir cle me they have pierced my hands and feet i can see all my bones they divide my garments among them and cast lost for my raiment but you yhvh be not far away deliver my soul from the sword my life from the power of the dog save me from the mouth of the lion and my afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull it would seem quite convincing and i m sure the early christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too unfortunately this prophecy has a fatal flaw the words have pierced really do not exist in the psalm the correct hebrew translation is yea dogs are round about me a company of evildoers encircles me like the lion they are at my hands and feet in hebrew the phrase like the lion and a very rare verb form which can mean pierced differ by one phonetic character the word in the hebrew text is literally like the lion ka ari which makes sense in the context and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer it is convenience that would urge a christian to change the word to ka aru but to add the needed yet artificial weight to the prophecy this is just what the christian translators have chosen to do while the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to jesus its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators apart from the erroneous verse the psalm does not lend itself to jesus so easily verse speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross this naturally fits the psalm s true subject king david as a side note we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands the palms but rather the forearms this doesn t say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms but then facts aren t bound by our religious beliefs matthew escapes culpability this time as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord jesus but the psalm like many others was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of jesus s life and death how much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for christian theology it is easy to see for those who are not faithful fundamentalists how some of the events in the new testament might have been enhanced by scribes such as the eager matthew but it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims so far this has not said good things for st matthew the reference to the piercing looks a lot like jesus s crucifixion john s gospel recount written about years after the fact tells us at jesus s execution jn but one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear and out came blood and water these things took place that scripture be fulfilled the will look on him whom they ve pierced of course this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context prophet zechariah tells us how much of the nation of israel will split off from jerusalem and judah and go to war with them zc and yhvh will give victory to judah and on that day i will seek to destroy the nations that come against jerusalem in judah and i will pour a spirit of compassion and supplication on jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have pierced they will mourn and weep bitterly over him like you weep over a firstborn child john s attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that matthew s attempts matthew at least usually excontexts more than just one passage john s errors are grossly obvious and blatant here it does not speak well for any of the gospel writers as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded reckoned with transgressors after his arrest jesus is quickly executed for claiming the jewish kingship messiahship according to one version of the gospel tale jesus gets executed along with two thieves mk and with him they crucified two robbers one on his right one on his left and so the scripture was fulfilled which says he was reckoned with the transgressors here mark is trying to link jesus to a passage in isaiah about the servant nation of israel the passage is not about the messiah for if one reads the whole chapter of isaiah and its surrounding chapters one sees that the servant is a nation the verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past not a prediction of what is to come in any event the servant is thought of as a criminal this also happens to fit the description of jesus had the passage really been about the messiah it still is not at all clear why executing jesus between two thieves would fulfill the prophecy in isaiah jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry he was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy at least in this case as we see that mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons mark goes on to tell us how those who were crucified with jesus also reviled him this is to be expected from a couple of robbers of course in his later recount st luke decides to change some things luke tells us lk and one of the criminals who was hanged with him railed aren t you the messiah save yourself and us this certainly fits with mark s recount which tells how the people who crucified jesus said save yourself and that the robbers did the same but then luke goes on but the other criminal rebuked the first saying don t you fear g d since you are under the same sentence of condemnation and we indeed justly so for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds but this man has done nothing wrong and he said jesus remember me when you come in your kingdom and jesus answered verily i say to you today you will be with me in paradise now this little dialogue seems highly contrived it stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech we have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering such a man apparently noble and of principle doesn t seem likely to have been a robber we wonder at the amount of theatrics created by luke of course luke s recount also disagrees with mark s luke has only one criminal revile jesus not both it is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of g d do not have this avenue open this is yet another example of a writer trying to take an old testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology in this case the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems as we have seen the end of the world mt now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the new testament it is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of christianity jesus mentions the destruction of the jewish temples and buildings and his disciples ask him about this and about the end of the world which he has been warning about the disciples tell us when will this the temple s destruction be and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age jesus take care that no one leads you astray for many will come in my name saying i am the christ you will hear of wars and rumours of wars for this must take place but the end is not yet for nation will rise against nation all this is but the beginning of the birthpangs they will deliver you up put you to death and false prophets will arise and lead many astray but he who endures to the end will be saved this gospel will be preached throughout the whole world a testimony to the nations and then the end will come so when you see the desolation spoken of by the prophet daniel let those who are in judea flee to the mountains immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened the stars will fall from heaven then will appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and all the tribes of the earth will mourn and see the son of man coming and he will send out his angels and gather his elect learn the lesson of the fig tree as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves you know that summer is near so also when you see all these things you will know that he is near at the very gate truly i say to you this generation will not pass away until all these things take place but of the day and hour no one knows not the angels not the son but only the father therefore you also must be ready for the son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect from this it is clear that jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples he tells them that although he doesn t know the exact day or hour that it will come and thus they must be ready theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this holy error but unfortunately jesus made himself to explicit he told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the end and that they in particular should prepare for it prepare to be swept away there have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the bible and said that the phrase this generation shall not pass away really means this race of people will not pass away of course the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that the generation of the disciples it is an interesting notion that when god decided to learn greek he didn t learn it well enough to make himself clear but it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples at least some of them are supposed to live to the end of the world the charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the apostles responses it becomes abundantly clear from rev peter john and rev that jesus meant exactly what he said the end was very near for years christians have rationalised this th chapter of matthew or ignored its meaning altogether for years they have waited for their executed leader to come back hearing of wars and rumours of wars sure that he is coming soon surely he must be all we must do is wait can you imagine how tired he must be sitting around up there being holy waiting for just the right moment to spring so shortly after his crucifixion jesus of nazareth joshua ben joseph died it is said that after three days or three days and three nights or three periods of time or three eternal seconds or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble he was seen again resurrected glowing with divine radiance then the saviour decided it wasn t in the best interests of his new religion to stick around and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven so the story goes anyway as has been seen there were many things attributed to jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down to them jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture we have seen though that this matter is quite shaky but throughout church history christians have held fast to faith in simple belief what doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force faith and forgetfulness kept away from question to question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters thus for years the prophecies cited in the new testament have gone on largely accepted things may well continue that way for some time pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of christianity have been accepted and used properly or improperly to support wars and persecution i suppose there is one prophecy of which christianity can securely keep hold mt jesus don t think that i have come to bring peace on earth i haven t come to bring peace but rather a sword",1403

"from mathew subject alt atheism faq constructing a logical argument summary includes a list of logical fallacies keywords faq atheism argument fallacies logic expires thu may gmt distribution world organization mantis consultants cambridge uk supersedes lines archive name atheism logic alt atheism archive name logic last modified april version constructing a logical argument although there is much argument on usenet the general quality of argument found is poor this article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic in the hope of improving the general level of debate logic is the science of reasoning proof thinking or inference concise oed logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not valid or invalid of course one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly nevertheless a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable the matter is very much open for debate this document merely explains how to use logic given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job propositions or statements are the building blocks of a logical argument a proposition is a statement which is either true or false for example it is raining or today is tuesday propositions may be either asserted said to be true or denied said to be false note that this is a technical meaning of deny not the everyday meaning the proposition is the meaning of the statement not the particular arrangement of words used to express it so god exists and there exists a god both express the same proposition an argument is to quote the monty python sketch a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition an argument consists of three stages first of all the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated these are called the premises of the argument they are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions premises or assertions are often indicated by phrases such as because since obviously and so on the phrase obviously is often viewed with suspicion as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises if something doesn t seem obvious to you don t be afraid to question it you can always say oh yes you re right it is obvious when you ve heard the explanation next the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference in inference one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted there are various forms of valid inference the propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference inference is often denoted by phrases such as implies that or therefore finally we arrive at the conclusion of the argument the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as therefore it follows that we conclude and so on the conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference for example every event has a cause premise the universe has a beginning premise all beginnings involve an event premise this implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event inference therefore the universe has a cause inference and conclusion note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument a proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument the terms do not make sense in isolation sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above for example the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated afterwards in support of the conclusion this is perfectly valid if sometimes a little confusing recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument some statements look like arguments but are not for example if the bible is accurate jesus must either have been insane an evil liar or the son of god this is not an argument it is a conditional statement it does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its conclusion it also suffers from a number of other logical flaws but we ll come to those later another example god created you therefore do your duty to god the phrase do your duty to god is not a proposition since it is neither true nor false therefore it is not a conclusion and the sentence is not an argument finally causality is important consider a statement of the form a because b if we re interested in establishing a and b is offered as evidence the statement is an argument if we re trying to establish the truth of b then it is not an argument it is an explanation for example there must be something wrong with the engine of my car because it will not start this is an argument my car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine this is an explanation there are two traditional types of argument deductive and inductive a deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions that is an argument where if the premises are true the conclusion must also be true a deductive argument is either valid or invalid a valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true then the conclusion is true an inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion inductive arguments are not valid or invalid however we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments and about how probable their premises are there are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive however we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing it is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds this is because of the slightly counter intuitive nature of implication which we must now consider more carefully obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions however an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions for example all insects have wings premise woodlice are insects premise therefore woodlice have wings conclusion here the conclusion is not true because the argument s premises are false if the argument s premises were true however the conclusion would be true the argument is thus entirely valid more subtly we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises as in all fish live in the sea premise dolphins are fish premise therefore dolphins live in the sea conclusion however the one thing we can not do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises we can therefore draw up a truth table for implication the symbol denotes implication a is the premise b the conclusion t and f represent true and false respectively premise conclusion inference a b a b f f t if the premises are false and the inference f t t valid the conclusion can be true or false t f f if the premises are true and the conclusion false the inference must be invalid t t t if the premises are true and the inference valid the conclusion must be true a sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true a sound argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments to delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy it is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument these pitfalls are known as fallacies in everyday english the term fallacy is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs this is fair enough but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument especially if the argument appears valid or convincing so for the purposes of this discussion we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely by studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them the following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive argumentum ad baculum appeal to force the appeal to force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion it is often used by politicians and can be summarized as might makes right the force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer for example thus there is ample proof of the truth of the bible all those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in hell argumentum ad hominem argumentum ad hominem is literally argument directed at the man the abusive variety of argumentum ad hominem occurs when instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion this is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it for example atheism is an evil philosophy it is practised by communists and murderers sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by showing for example that he is a known perjurer this is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness and not argumentum ad hominem however it does not demonstrate that the witness s testimony is false to conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the argumentum ad ignorantiam see elsewhere in this list the circumstantial form of argumentum ad hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent s particular circumstances for example it is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food how can you argue otherwise when you re quite happy to wear leather shoes this is an abusive charge of inconsistency used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent s argument this fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion for example of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing you re white this particular form of argumentum ad hominem when one alleges that one s adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests is also known as poisoning the well argumentum ad ignorantium argumentum ad ignorantium means argument from ignorance this fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false or equivalently when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true a basic scientific principle examples of course the bible is true nobody can prove otherwise of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist nobody has shown any proof that they are real note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty also in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not occur for example a flood as described in the bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth the earth does not have a tenth as much water even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles therefore no such flood occurred in science we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred we can not conclude with certainty that it has not occurred however argumentum ad misericordiam this is the appeal to pity also known as special pleading the fallacy is committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion accepted for example i did not murder my mother and father with an axe please don t find me guilty i m suffering enough through being an orphan argumentum ad populum this is known as appealing to the gallery or appealing to the people to commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people this form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language for example pornography must be banned it is violence against women the bible must be true millions of people know that it is are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools argumentum ad numeram this fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum it consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition the more likely it is that that proposition is correct argumentum ad verecundiam the appeal to authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion for example isaac newton was a genius and he believed in god this line of argument is not always completely bogus for example reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject for example we can distinguish quite clearly between stephen hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation and john searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer hawking is a physicist and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed searle is a linguist so it is questionable whether he is well qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence the fallacy of accident the fallacy of accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose accidental circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable it is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific for example christians generally dislike atheists you are a christian so you must dislike atheists this fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules converse accident hasty generalization this fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident it occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases for example jim bakker was an insincere christian therefore all christians are insincere sweeping generalization dicto simpliciter a sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable a sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc these are known as false cause fallacies the fallacy of non causa pro causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause for example i took an aspirin and prayed to god and my headache disappeared so god cured me of the headache the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event for example the soviet union collapsed after taking up atheism therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons cum hoc ergo propter hoc this fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc it asserts that because two events occur together they must be causally related and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause s of the events petitio principii this fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached circulus in demonstrando this fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach often the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument for example homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret and will be open to blackmail therefore homosexuals can not be allowed to hold government office note that the argument is entirely circular the premise is the same as the conclusion an argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the british secret services official ban on homosexual employees another example is the classic we know that god exists because the bible tells us so and we know that the bible is true because it is the word of god complex question fallacy of interrogation this is the fallacy of presupposition one example is the classic loaded question have you stopped beating your wife the question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked this trick is often used by lawyers in cross examination when they ask questions like where did you hide the money you stole similarly politicians often ask loaded questions such as how long will this ec interference in our affairs be allowed to continue or does the chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization ignoratio elenchi the fallacy of irrelevant conclusion consists of claiming that an argument supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion for example a christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of christianity are undoubtably true if he then argues at length that christianity is of great help to many people no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that christian teachings are true sadly such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light equivocation equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument for example what could be more affordable than free software but to make sure that it remains free that users can do what they like with it we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable amphiboly amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing accent accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning in this case the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized for example consider we should not speak ill of our friends and we should not speak ill of our friends fallacies of composition one fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole for example the bicycle is made entirely of low mass components and is therefore very lightweight the other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items for example a car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses fallacy of division the fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition like its opposite it exists in two varieties the first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts for example you are studying at a rich college therefore you must be rich the other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item for example ants can destroy a tree therefore this ant can destroy a tree the slippery slope argument this argument states that should one event occur so will other harmful events there is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event for example if we legalize marijuana then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we ll have a nation full of drug addicts on welfare therefore we can not legalize marijuana a is based on b fallacies is a type of fallacies these fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar examples isn t history based upon faith if so then isn t the bible also a form of history islam is based on faith christianity is based on faith so isn t islam a form of christianity cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry so aren t dogs a form of cat affirmation of the consequent this fallacy is an argument of the form a implies b b is true therefore a is true to understand why it is a fallacy examine the truth table for implication given earlier denial of the antecedent this fallacy is an argument of the form a implies b a is false therefore b is false again the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy note that this fallacy is different from non causa pro causa the latter has the form a implies b a is false therefore b is false where a does not in fact imply b at all here the problem is not that the implication is invalid rather it is that the falseness of a does not allow us to deduce anything about b converting a conditional this fallacy is an argument of the form if a then b therefore if b then a argumentum ad antiquitam this is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old or because that s the way it s always been argumentum ad novitam this is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else argumentum ad crumenam the fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness that those with more money are more likely to be right argumentum ad lazarum the fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier this fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam argumentum ad nauseam this is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard an argumentum ad nauseum is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something bifurcation also referred to as the black and white fallacy bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist plurium interrogationum many questions this fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question non sequitur a non sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it red herring this fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed so that everyone s attention is diverted away from the points being made towards a different conclusion reification hypostatization reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing shifting the burden of proof the burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition shifting the burden of proof a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made the source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise straw man the straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else s position so that it can be attacked more easily then to knock down that misrepresented position then to conclude that the original position has been demolished it is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made the extended analogy the fallacy of the extended analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over the fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situations in an argument about a general rule constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each other this fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about anti cryptography legislation i believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it such a position is odious it implies that you would not have supported martin luther king are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for black liberation how dare you tu quoque this is the famous you too fallacy it occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it for instance you re just being randomly abusive so you ve been

"from nabil ayoub subject re monophysites and mike walker organization u of wisconsin madison college of engineering lines hello src readers again the misconception that copts among other oriental orthodox churches believe in monophysitism pops up again we had a discussion about it a while ago in article d andrew byler writes the proper term for what mike expresses is monophysitism this was a heresy that was condemned in the council of chalcedon in ad it grew up in reaction to nestorianism which held that the son and jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily monophysitism is held by the copts of egypt and ethipoia and by the jacobites of syria and the armenian orthodox then ofm comments these issues get mighty subtle when you see people saying different things it s often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things or whether they are using different terminology i don t think there s any question that there is a problem with nestorius and i would agree that the saying christ had a human form without a real human nature or will is heretical but i d like to be a bit wary about the copts armenians etc recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought with my appreciation to the moderator i believe that further elaboration is needed this is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue of the copt net newsletter under the authority of the eastern roman empire of constantinople as opposed to the western empire of rome the patriarchs and popes of alexandria played leading roles in christian theology they were invited everywhere to speak about the christian faith st cyril pope of alexandria was the head of the ecumenical council which was held in ephesus in the year a d it was said that the bishops of the church of alexandria did nothing but spend all their time in meetings this leading role however did not fare well when politics started to intermingle with church affairs it all started when the emperor marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the church the response of st dioscorus the pope of alexandria who was later exiled to this interference was clear you have nothing to do with the church these political motives became even more apparent in chalcedon in when the coptic church was unfairly accused of following the teachings of eutyches who believed in monophysitism this doctrine maintains that the lord jesus christ has only one nature the divine not two natures the human as well as the divine the coptic church has never believed in monophysitism the way it was portrayed in the council of chalcedon in that council monophysitism meant believing in one nature copts believe that the lord is perfect in his divinity and he is perfect in his humanity but his divinity and his humanity were united in one nature called the nature of the incarnate word which was reiterated by st cyril of alexandria copts thus believe in two natures human and divine that are united in one without mingling without confusion and without alteration from the declaration of faith at the end of the coptic divine liturgy these two natures did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye also from the declaration of faith at the end of the coptic divine liturgy the coptic church was misunderstood in the th century at the council of chalcedon perhaps the council understood the church correctly but they wanted to exile the church to isolate it and to abolish the egyptian independent pope despite all of this the coptic church has remained very strict and steadfast in its faith whether it was a conspiracy from the western churches to exile the coptic church as a punishment for its refusal to be politically influenced or whether pope dioscurus didn t quite go the extra mile to make the point that copts are not monophysite the coptic church has always felt a mandate to reconcile semantic differences between all christian churches this is aptly expressed by the current th successor of st mark pope shenouda iii to the coptic church faith is more important than anything and others must know that semantics and terminology are of little importance to us throughout this century the coptic church has played an important role in the ecumenical movement the coptic church is one of the founders of the world council of churches it has remained a member of that council since a d the coptic church is a member of the all african council of churches aacc and the middle east council of churches mecc the church plays an important role in the christian movement by conducting dialogues aiming at resolving the theological differences with the catholic greek orthodox presbyterian and evangelical churches as a final note the oriental orthodox and eastren orthodox did sign a common statement of christology in which the heresey of monophysitism was condemned so the coptic orthodox church does not believe in monophysitism peace nabil nabil ayoub ____ __ ____ engine research center dept of mechanical engineering ___ __ university of wisconsin madison _____ __ _ _____ as i mentioned in a brief apology the comment quoted above from me is confused i appear to say that nestorius was monophysite as andrew byler correctly stated it the nestorians and monophysites were actually opposite parties the point i was making which nabil explains in some detail is that some groups that have been considered heretical probably aren t chalcedon was a compromise between two groups the alexandrians and antiochenes it adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in both camps while ruling out the extremes i agree that there were extremes that were heretical however in the course of the complex politics of the time it appears that some people got rejected who didn t intend heresy but simply used language that was not understood or even was mispresented and some seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine there are groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps this posting discussed the descendants of the alexandrians there are also a remaining nestorians like some of the current so called monophysites there is reason to believe that the current so called nestorians are not heretical either they sheltered nestorius from what they saw as unfair treatment but claim they did not adopt his heresies and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of the antiochene tradition clh",1456

like the doctrine of hell there s nothing like a preacher to put fear into an ignorant man if god hadn t created hell in the first place there d be no no need to die and save us isn t it also a bit paradoxical to say god died when in fact no such thing is remotely possible can the infinite die your using th century concepts to interprete st century writers of course in your termonology god could not cease to exist however that is not what death ever means in the scriptures if you will study the word you will see that it signifies separation death is separation not ceastation this is the reason for the agony of the cross for the first time in eternity one member of the godhead was separated from the other two i once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived she was as personable as any saint ever imagined she was to become my girlfriend for several years however having been drafted we were separated by distance to me that was a form of death later she decided that she couldn t wait for me to come home and bid me adue that to me was death it was separation from that which had made me whole death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from his fellowship not because he chose to send you into outer darkness but because you chose to go there did you know that jesus talked more about hell than he did about heaven thank you for this info what respect i had for the man now has been diminished tenfold i promise never again to say how wise or loving this man was when i rebelled against my earthly father he spanked me i found no wisdom in that until i had grown older and especially until i had my own children he was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if i continued on my suicidal course he did it in love though i interpreted it as harsh and unloving if god warns of impending danger that is love if choose to let us do as we please and then at the end tell us the rules that would be harsh you have a conscience no matter how calused or fallen it is that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear being jesus was allegedly god i doubt he could honestly feel the pinpricks man dealt him this may give light to the error of your understanding one must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith faith and knowledge are inseparable jesus most certainly felt the pinpricks of life as the scripture say heb for we do not have a high priest who can not sympathize with our weaknesses but one who has been tempted in all things as we are yet without sin the kenosis passage of phil states that he gave up his godhead attributes when he took upon himself humanity it has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this it was to be my phd thesis the consciousness of christ i have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study including clh it is my conclussion that as jesus the nd member of the trinity actually suffered as we do he became part of the human race and experienced it as we do he grew in knowledge he chose not to grasp his omniscience but chose to be taught it is my understanding that he was led of the spirit to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between jesus the man and jesus as god but in jn where the adulterous women was thrown before him the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took him by surprise that is he was not aware that this event was to take place in time he was living sequential history as you or i maybe some other time we can discuss this but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not thanks again for the info just so you know some friends and i are starting a freethinkers organization and i m going to use some of the info you provided for an organization intro duction i was once a member of that club the free thinker is a glorious ideal by contrast of course you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic inhibited reactionary and repressive i find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd if the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a christian or a buddhist or a marxist that is his right but what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his rational doubt when in fact he was led to it by his faith he must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a free thinker to criticize the christian it might equally be a rational doubt for the christian to criticize him as a humanist if there is no faith there can be no dout there is no faith which can not choose to cast doubt on some other faith pascal pointed out that sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive few speak dubiously of scepticism the fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else the person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths will be the devoted adherent of another in fact it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms hence the term a theist some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism in my campus ministry i ran across this more times than i care to remember however they disproved their own argument with every thought every word every point of logic that they used every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent that is to say that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary next time you re in a room of skeptics yell out look your fly is undone each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism to stress this is to belabor the obvious but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity the answer to this impasse lies in a rd way of knowing one which is based on presuppositions but if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral in other words another myth presuppositions my friend it is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt our own assumptions presuppostions even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence i tell you what if god condemns me for being honest he is unworthy of my worship better to burn in hell than to serve a tyrant in heaven of course that is hardly an original statement milton coined it but it had been in use for millenia it was even used in the first highlander movie but again your presuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of god you are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology not what he has revealed of himself through history through his prophets through his word and lastly but most of all thru his son if you are to reject

lines new in this version challenge plus an addendum summarizing charley s responses to date this is a posting made periodically in an attempt to encourage charley wingate to address direct challenges to his evidently specious claims i ll continue to re post periodically until he answers them publicly indicates that he won t answer them stops posting to alt atheism the alt atheism community tells me to stop or i get totally bored i apologize for the somewhat juvenile nature of this approach but i m at a loss to figure out another way to crack his intransigence and seeming intellectual dishonesty this is re post charley i can t help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts i submit that you don t answer them because you can not answer them without running afoul of your own logic and i once again challenge you to prove me wrong to make the task as easy for you as possible i ll present concise re statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period i will re post this article with suitable additions and deletions at such time that i notice a post by you on another topic i will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup i would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice if you can be kind enough to re post or e mail such articles i will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question and remove it from this list now to the questions after claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed then semi retracting that claim by stating that you weren t referring to all atheists i asked you to name some atheists who you feel don t fit your patterns to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of you failed to do so please do so now question can you name any a a posters who do not fit into your stereotype here is the context for the question this is not true for everyone on this board and you are out of line in assuming that it is you however deleted the text further along where i said that i didn t mean to imply that everybody s experience was along the same lines whether or not you mean to make such implications you do so repeatedly allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint can you name those atheists that you ve come across who do not fit into the patterns that you theorize you have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that senses and reason are all we have to go by and when pressed you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation i have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason you failed to do so please do so now question can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning here is the context for the question revelation is not reason and if we do have revelation then reasoning is not all we have first show me that revelation exists second if revelation is not perceived through the senses how exactly is it perceived according to my webster s revelation is an act of revealing or communicating divine truth now tell me how such a thing can be revealed communicated other than via the senses tell me how you can interpret this revelation other than with reason that is using your brain to interpret what you are sensing when i say there is no way for a human being to interface with the universe other than via the senses as interpreted by reason your brain it is because this is the simple truth if you have another mechanism of interface by all means share it with us then later you can not escape the fact that our entire interface with the universe is our senses and our reason period again this is indefensible no it is simple truth i challenge you to show me otherwise then later few mystics will agree to this assertion and the common defense of redefining senses to absorb for instance mystical experiences is begs the question of whether some senses are better than others i allow you the broadest definition of senses to make things easier for you now show me that mystical experiences exist remember you aren t allowed to go by testimony of others e g mystics since you have dismissed my testimony as unreliable you know tainted by my own bias further once these mystical thingies are absorbed show me evidence that a human can recognize and respond to them short of interpretation via that person s reasoning capabilities i challenge you to show me these things if you can not do so you might as well give up the fight then later let me reiterate you have not explained your interpretation of your experiences so it is not possible for me to have attacked them in point of fact i specifically challenged you to explain this revelation stuff that you were talking about and i note for the record that you appear to have declined my challenge what is it how is it sensed how is it interpreted and how does this sensing and interpretation occur without the conduit of our senses and reasoning abilities you have answered none of these questions that go straight to the heart of your claims if you can t answer them your claims are entirely specious you have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a a posters are unverifiable and fantastical i asked you to identify one such claim that i have made you have failed to do so please do so now question have i made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical if so please repeat them here is the context for the question i must thank david wood a most sensitive and intelligent if wrong posting then later likewise the reference to unverifiable fantastical claims represents fairly accurately my reaction to all of the claims to dispassionate analysis that are repeated in this group give me your address and i ll be pleased to send you a dictionary failing that can you name one claim that i have made that is in any sense unverifiable or fantastical i demand that you retract this statement if you can not offer up evidence if you follow your usual pattern of ignoring the challenge then you are simply an asshole first you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason then later you stated that if one accepted the axioms of reason that one couldn t help but become atheist i asked you to explain the contradiction your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent an opinion not shared by others that i have asked be they atheist or theist you have failed to answer the question please do so now question do you retract your claim that a a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason despite their testimony to that effect if you don t retract that claim do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism here is the context for the question first quote we have here a bunch of people who claim that their position is based on reason it is up to atheists to prove it to me then second quote but i do not see how one can accept these axioms and not end up with an atheistic point of view first you claimed that you would probably not answer these challenges because they contained too much in the way of included text from previous posts later you implied that you wouldn t respond because i was putting words in your mouth please clarify this seeming contradiction question do you prefer to respond to challenges that include context from your own posts or that i paraphrase your positions in order to avoid included text here is the context for the question first you said my ordinary rules are that i don t read articles over over lines or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first screen these are not rules of morality but practicality then later if someone is not going to argue with my version of my position then they can not be argued with as usual your responses are awaited with anticipation dave wood p s for the record below is a compilation of charley s responses to these challenges to date this makes no sense to me at all it gives the appearance either of utter incoherence or of answering some question of mr wood s imagination mr wood i do not subscribe to the opinion that a gauntlet thrown down on the net requires any response whatsoever at some point i might read and respond to your article and then again i might not my ordinary rules are that i don t read articles over over lines or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first screen these are not rules of morality but practicality i left out something else i don t respond to utmost on my list of things to avoid are arguments about the arguments meta arguments as some call them when i have to start saying that s not what i said and the response is did so there s no reason to continue if someone is not going to argue with my version of my position then they can not be argued with",1506

stimulate this file last updated what is otis otis is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal scrutiny and distribution digital immortality the basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near forever the gifs and jpgs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future perhaps they ll be put in different formats perhaps only surviving on backup tapes but they ll be there and someone will dig them up if that doesn t interest you otis also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors suddenly life is breathed into your work and by merit of it s stimulus it will travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons spectators are welcome also feel free to browse the gallery and let the artists know what you think of their efforts keep your own copies of the images to look at when you ve got the gumption that s what they re here for where otis currently as of has two ftp sites projects otis the uwi site sunsite unc edu pub multimedia pictures otis the sunsite you can also gopher to this site for otis as well merely anonymous ftp to either site on internet and change to the appropriate directory don t forget to get busy and use the bin command to make sure you re in binary otis has also been spreading to some dial up bbs systems around north america the following systems have a substancial supply of otistuff underground cafe omaha lines cyberden sanfran usenet waffle iron how do you contribute what happens is you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely photo get it scanned into an image file then either ftp put it in the contrib incoming directory or use uuencode to send it to me email addresses at eof in email after the image is received it will be put into the correct directory computer originated works are also welcome otis directories house two types of image files gif and jpg gif and jpg files require oddly enough a gif or jpg viewer to see these viewers are available for all types of computers at most large ftp sites around internet jpg viewers are a bit tougher to find if you can t find one but do have a gif viewer you can obtain a jpg to gif conversion program which will change jpg files to a standard gif format otis also accepts animation files when you submit image files please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used in publications or other projects or if it is merely for people to view also include some biographical information on yourself we ll be having info files on each contributing artist and their works you can also just upload a text file of info about yourself instead of emailing if you have pictures but no scanner there is hope merely send copies to the otis project c o ed stastny po bx omaha ne i will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will scan them include an ample sase if you want your stuff back also include information on each image preferably a line description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it s finally put if you have preferences as to what the images are to be named include those as well conversely if you have a scanner and would like to help out please contact me and we ll arrange things if you want to submit your works by disk peachy merely send a disk to the above address omaha and a sase if you want your disk back this is good for people who don t have direct access to encoders or ftp but do have access to a scanner we accept disks in either mac or ibm compatible format if possible please submit image files as gif or jpg if you can t we can convert from most formats we d just rather not have to at senders request we can also fill disks with as much otis as they can stand even if you don t have stuff to contribute you can send a blank disk and an sase or for disk postage and packing to get a slab o otis as of we re at about megabytes of files and growing email me for current archive size and directory distribution the images distributed by the otis project may be distributed freely on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way save to convert from one image format to another in fact we encourage files to be distributed to local bulletin boards and such if you could please transport the appropriate text files along with the images it would also be nice if you d send me a note when you did post images from otis to your local bbs i just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is it s the purpose of otis to get these images spread out as much as possible if you have the time please upload a few to your favorite bbs system or even just post this info file there it would be keen of you use if you want to use any of the works you find on the otis directory you ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the stipulations of the permission such as free copy of publication or full address credit you will either find this in the rm file for the image or series of images or in the artists directory under the artists name if permission isn t explicitly given then you ll have to contact the artist to ask for it if no info is available email me and i ll get in contact with the artist for you or give you their contact information when you do use permitted work it s always courteous to let the artist know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files naming images please keep the names of your files in dos format that means keep the filename before jpg or gif to eight characters or less the way i usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or four digit code for the series of images plus the series number thus leonardo devinci s fifth mechanical drawing would be something like ldmek gif or ldmek jpg or ldmech gif etc keeping the names under characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems creating image files when creating image files be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture this gives people a reference in case they d like to contact you you may also want to include a title address or other information you d like people to know hmmm that s about it for now more guidelines will be added as needed your input is expected disclaimer the otis project has no connection to the church of otis a sumerian deity or it s followers be they pope priest or ezine administrator we do take sacrifices and donations however disclaimer the otis project is here for the distribution of original image files the files will go to the public at large it s possible as with any form of mass media that someone could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain unless you ve given permission for that it s illegal otis takes no responsibility for this in simple

universe is so complex it must have been designed independent evidence that the bible is true godel s incompleteness theorem george bush on atheism and patriotism i know where hell is biblical contradictions wanted the usa is a christian nation the usa is not a christian nation subject what is the purpose of this newsgroup typical posting why have a newsgroup about atheism why do atheists organize in groups what is there to discuss response many things are discussed here including whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one s family prayer in schools discrimination against atheists sunday trading laws the satanic child abuse myth whether one should be an overt atheist or stay in the closet how religious societies prey sic on new college students how to get rid of unwanted proselytizers whether religion is a danger to society and or the individual why people become atheists of course inevitably alt atheism tends to attract evangelical christians looking for someone to convert most readers of the newsgroup don t want to be preached to although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure from tearing apart particularly ill considered or uninformed postings subject hitler was an atheist typical posting hitler was an atheist and look at what he did response adolf hitler was emphatically not an atheist as he said himself the folkish minded man in particular has the sacred duty each in his own denomination of making _people_stop_just_talking_ superficially_of_god s_will _and_actually_fulfill_god s_will _and_ not_let_god s_word_be_desecrated _ orig ital for god s will gave men their form their essence and their abilities anyone who destroys his work is declaring war on the lord s creation the divine will therefore let every man be active each in his own denomination if you please and let every man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his religious community and tries to butt into the other hence today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will of the almighty creator _by_defending_myself_against_the_jew _i_am_ fighting_for_the_work_of_the_lord _ orig ital adolf hitler from mein kampf trans ralph mannheim of course someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong it s also entirely possible that hitler was lying when he claimed to believe in god we certainly can t conclude that he s an atheist though subject the bible proves it typical posting in the bible it says that response most of the readers of alt atheism feel that the bible is of questionable accuracy as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before thus any claimed truth in it is of questionable legitimacy this isn t to say that the bible has no truth in it simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to interpretation any claim that a passage means one thing and one thing only is not legitimate note that this feeling tends to extend to other books it is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion subject pascal s wager typical posting if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing but if you don t believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you will go to hell therefore it is foolish to be an atheist response this argument is known as pascal s wager it has several flaws firstly it does not indicate which religion to follow indeed there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there this is often described as the avoiding the wrong hell problem if a person is a follower of religion x he may end up in religion y s version of hell secondly the statement that if you believe in god and turn out to be incorrect you have lost nothing is not true suppose you re believing in the wrong god the true god might punish you for your foolishness consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely or at least that they are of comparable likelihood if in fact the possibility of there being a god is close to zero the argument becomes much less persuasive so sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already also many feel that for intellectually honest people belief is based on evidence with some amount of intuition it is not a matter of will or cost benefit analysis formally speaking the argument consists of four statements one does not know whether god exists not believing in god is bad for one s eternal soul if god does exist believing in god is of no consequence if god does not exist therefore it is in one s interest to believe in god there are two approaches to the argument the first is to view as an assumption and as a consequence of it one problem with this approach in the abstract is that it creates information from no information this is considered invalid in information theory statement indicates one has no information about god but statement indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about god this violates information entropy information has been extracted from no information at no cost the alternative approach is to claim that and are both assumptions the problem with this is that is then basically an assumption which states the christian position and only a christian will agree with that assumption the argument thus collapses to if you are a christian it is in your interests to believe in god a rather vacuous tautology and not the way pascal intended the argument to be viewed the biggest reason why pascal s wager is a failure is that if god is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager he will spurn the latter assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him subject what is occam s razor typical posting people keep talking about occam s razor what is it response william of occam formulated a principle which has become known as occam s razor in its original form it said do not multiply entities unnecessarily that is if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity then do so nowadays when people refer to occam s razor they generally express it more generally for example as take the simplest solution the relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations for what we see around us there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there which came into being as a result of natural processes there is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there and there is also a god who created the universe clearly this god must be of non zero complexity given that both explanations fit the facts occam s razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two solution number one unfortunately some argue that there is a third even more simple solution there isn t an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there we just imagine that there is this third option leads us logically towards solipsism which many people find unacceptable subject why it s good to believe in jesus typical posting i want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion response preaching is not appreciated feel free to talk about your religion but please do not write postings that are on a conversion theme such postings do not belong on alt atheism and will be rejected from alt atheism moderated try the newsgroup talk religion misc you would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you please do unto others as you would have them do unto you often theists make their basic claims about god in the form of lengthy analogies or parables be aware that atheists have heard of god and know the basic claims about him if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that god exists and brings salvation you may as well not post it since it tells us nothing we have not been told before subject why i know that god exists typical posting i know from personal experience and prayer that god exists response just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist that evidence varies from person to person furthermore without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things that they have been abducted by ufos visited by the ghost of elvis and so on subject einstein and god does not play dice typical posting albert einstein believed in god do you think you re cleverer than him response einstein did once comment that god does not play dice with the universe this quotation is commonly mentioned to show that einstein believed in the christian god used this way it is out of context it refers to einstein s refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory furthermore einstein s religious background was jewish rather than christian a better quotation showing what einstein thought about god is the following i believe in spinoza s god who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists not in a god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings einstein was unable to accept quantum theory because of his belief in an objective orderly reality a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer he believed that qm was incomplete and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations so far no such better theory has been found and much evidence suggests that it never will be a longer quote from einstein appears in science philosophy and religion a symposium published by the conference on science philosophy and religion in their relation to the democratic way of life inc new york in it he says the more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature for him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural events to be sure the doctrine of a personal god interfering with natural events could never be refuted italics his in the real sense by science for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot but i am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal for a doctrine which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark will of necessity lose its effect on mankind with incalculable harm to human progress in their struggle for the ethical good teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal god that is give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests in their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the good the true and the beautiful in humanity itself this is to be sure a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task einstein has also said it was of course a lie what you read about my religous convictions a lie which is being systematically repeated i do not believe in a personal god and i have never denied this but have expressed it clearly if something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it the latter quote is from albert einstein the human side edited by helen dukas and banesh hoffman and published by princeton university press also from the same book i do not believe in immortality of the individual and i consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it of course the fact that einstein chose not to believe in christianity does not in itself imply that christianity is false subject everyone worships something typical posting everyone worships something whether it s money power or god response if that is true everyone is a polytheist theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about if the atheists reactions to for example their families amount to worship then so do the theists subject why there must be a causeless cause typical posting sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member so chains of causes must all have a first element a causeless cause response the set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound but has no smallest member further even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion subject the universe is so complex it must have been designed typical posting the presence of design in the universe proves there is a god surely you don t think all this appeared here just by chance response this is known as the argument from design it is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk origins for a while there is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here however the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so called scientific creationism furthermore there is much evidence observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth the origin of the argument by design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as say a human is so improbable that surely it can t have come about by chance that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately but if human intelligence is so improbable surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely the approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the creationist position this leads us to the familiar theme of if a creator created the universe what created the creator but with the addition of spiralling improbability the only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just is or was from here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just is without introducing a creator indeed stephen hawking in his book a brief history of time explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent with no beginning or end the argument from design is often stated by analogy in the so called watchmaker argument one is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker or that it evolved naturally of course one assumes a watchmaker yet like the watch the universe is intricate and complex so the argument goes the universe too must have a creator the watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws over and above those common to all arguments by design firstly a watchmaker creates watches from pre existing materials whereas god is claimed to have created the universe from nothing these two sorts of creation are clearly fundamentally different and the analogy is therefore rather weak secondly a watchmaker makes watches but there are many other things in the world if we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor we wouldn t assume it was created by the watchmaker the argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creators each responsible for a different part of creation finally in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered and therefore stands out from the randomness of nature yet in the second part of the argument we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random but shows elements of order the watchmaker argument is thus internally inconsistent subject independent evidence that the bible is true typical posting the events of the new testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence for example response the writings of josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence early versions of josephus s work are thought not to have mentioned jesus or james the extant version discusses john in a non christian context many scholars believe that the original mentioned jesus and james in passing but that this was expanded by christian copyists several reconstructions of the original text have been published to this effect much information appears in the ecclesiastical history of eusebius about c e it is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily eusebius who is generally acknowledged as the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity it is eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material aside from the new testament the biographical information about jesus is more well documented for further information please consult the frequently asked questions file for the newsgroup soc religion christian subject godel s incompleteness theorem typical posting godel s incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the bible to be both true and complete response godel s first incompleteness theorem says that in any consistent formal system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be valid or invalid true or false within that formal system technically speaking the system must also be recursive that is there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal system essentially all such systems can formulate what is known as a liar paradox the classic liar paradox sentence in ordinary english is this sentence is false note that if a proposition is undecidable the formal system can not even deduce that it is undecidable the logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined so claims that godel s incompleteness theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove the existence of god are worthless in isolation one can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of god simply by having the existence of god stated as an axiom this is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof however it may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with it may then be possible to show that godel s incompleteness theorem holds for that system however that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that god exists within the system furthermore it certainly wouldn t tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of god generally note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of god the formal systems are just abstractions another frequent claim is that godel s incompleteness theorem demonstrates that a religious text the bible the book of mormon or whatever can not be both consistent and universally applicable religious texts are not formal systems so such claims are nonsense subject george bush on atheism and patriotism typical posting did george bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens response the following exchange took place at the chicago airport between robert i sherman of american atheist press and george bush on august sherman is a fully accredited reporter and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps the republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for illinois the discussion turned to the presidential primary rs what will you do to win the votes of americans who are atheists gb i guess i m pretty weak in the atheist community faith in god is important to me rs surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of americans who are atheists gb no i don t know that atheists should be considered as citizens nor should they be considered patriots this is one nation under god rs do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation of state and church gb yes i support the separation of church and state i m just not very high on atheists upi reported on may that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks the exchange appeared in the boulder daily camera on monday february it can also be found in free enquiry magazine fall issue volume number page on october mr sherman had a confrontation with ed murnane cochairman of the bush quayle illinois campaign this concerned a lawsuit mr sherman had filed to stop the community consolidated school district chicago illinois from forcing his first grade atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states as one nation under god bush s phrase the following conversation took place rs american atheists filed the pledge of allegiance lawsuit yesterday does the bush campaign have an official response to this filing em it s bullshit rs what is bullshit em everything that american atheists does rob is bullshit rs thank you for telling me what the official position of the bush campaign is on this issue em you re welcome after bush s election american atheists wrote to bush asking him to retract his statement on february st c boyden gray counsel to the president replied on white house stationery that bush substantively stood by his original statement and wrote as you are aware the president is a religious man who neither supports atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or supported by the government for further information contact american atheist veterans at the american atheist press s cameron road address subject i know where hell is typical posting i know where hell is hell is in norway response there are several towns called hell in various countries around the world including norway and the usa whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it readers of alt atheism are now getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week subject biblical contradictions wanted typical posting does anyone have a list of biblical contradictions response american atheist press publish an atheist s handbook detailing biblical contradictions see the accompanying posting on atheist resources for details there is a file containing some biblical contradictions available from the see the contacts file for more information subject the usa is a christian nation typical posting because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers shouldn t the united states be considered a christian nation response based upon the writings of several important founding fathers it is clear that they never intended the us to be a christian nation here are some quotes there are many more what influence in fact have ecclesiastical establishments had on society in some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the civil authority on many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny in no instance have they been the guardians of the liberties of the people rulers who wish to subvert the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient auxiliaries a just government instituted to secure and perpetuate it needs them not james madison a memorial and remonstrance i almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved the cross consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced john adams in a letter to thomas jefferson history i believe furnishes no example of a priest ridden people maintaining a free civil government this marks the lowest grade of ignorance of which their political as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purpose thomas jefferson to baron von humboldt i can not conceive otherwise than that he the infinite father expects or requires no worship or praise from us but that he is even infinitely above it benjamin franklin from articles of belief and acts of religion nov subject the usa is not a christian nation typical posting is it true that george washington said that the united states is not in any sense founded upon the christian religion response no the quotation often given is in fact from article xi of the treaty of tripoli stat treaty series article as the government of the united states of america is not in any sense founded on the christian religion as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws religion or tranquility of musselmen and as the said states never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any mehomitan nation it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries the text may be found in the congressional record or in treaty collections such as charles bevans treaties and other international agreements of the united states of america vol pp the english text of the treaty of tripoli was approved by the u s senate on june and ratified by president john adams on june it was recently discovered that the arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation it lacks article xi altogether the person who translated the arabic to english was joel barlow consul general at algiers a

"from subject when are two people married lines listowner i have sent this to mr anderson privately post it only if you think it of general interest here is a copy of something i wrote for another list you may find it relevant a listmember asks what makes common law marriages wrong a common law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself there is nothing in the bible old or new testament about getting married by a preacher or by a priest jewish or christian and in fact jewish priests have never had any connection with weddings there is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the clergyman in fact the traditional christian view at least in the west is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage and that the clergyman is there only as a witness however the essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment two persons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound themselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife forsaking all others till death do them part the reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who is married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public ceremony is in order that society and the couple themselves may be clear about whether a commitment has been made suppose that we do away with the public ceremony the standard vows etc instead we have a man and a woman settling down to live together after a year or so the man says to the woman hey honey it was great while it lasted but i think it s time to move on she says what are you talking about he says i am leaving you and looking for someone prettier and younger she says but you can t we are married he says what are you talking about we never got married she says i remember distinctly what you said to me the night we first made love you said my love for you is as deep as the ocean as eternal as the stars as long as i live i am yours utterly and completely when i lie on my deathbed my last feeble breath will utter your name my he says oh that that was just rhetoric just poetry when a man is in a romantic mood he is bound to say all kinds of silly things like that you mustn t take them literally and that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is a matter of public record the church insists on it because it is her duty among other things to give moral advice and you can not give a man moral advice about his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married to whom if anybody and vice versa the state insists on it since the state has a concern with property rights with child care and support and therefore needs to know who has made what commitments to whom prospective fathers in law insist on it because they don t want their daughters seduced and abandoned prospective spouses insist on it because they want to make sure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment or just poetry and persons making vows themselves insist on making them formally and publicly in order that they may be clear in their own minds about what it is that they are doing and may know themselves that this is not just rhetoric this is the real thing hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the marriage commitment the church goes further and insists that when christians marry a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and record the vows on behalf of the church not because it is impossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman but in order to make sure that the couple understand what the christian teaching about marriage is and that they are in fact promising to be married in a christian sense the church also prefers a standard marriage vow and is wary of letting couples write their own vows for much the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they draw up a will or a contract certain language has been repeatedly used in wills and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it try to say the same thing in your own words and you may find that the probate judge s interpretation of them is not at all what you intended similarly the church prefers to avoid endless debates about whether you are my main squeeze and i am here for the long haul do in fact cover the same territory as forsaking all others and till death do us part this topic has come up on the list before is there any topic that hasn t one listmember was asking if a couple love each other and are living together isn t that marriage in the eyes of god eventually someone asked in that case what is their status if they break up is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce are they in a relationship that god forbids either of them to walk out on the original questioner said good grief i never thought of that in fact there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that someone who says we don t need a piece of paper or a ceremony in front of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each other is trying to have it both ways to have the advantages of marriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of bother at this point someone may say none of this applies to me and my mate we are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong commitment for better or worse forsaking all others till death us do part so in our case no ceremony is needed to this my reply would be the reason for requiring a driver s license is to keep dangerous drivers off the road what is wrong in itself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers but the existence of dangerous drivers however testing and licensing drivers is an obvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the number of dangerous drivers on the road therefore the state rightly makes and enforces such laws and you the citizen have a positive moral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter how much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are back to the original question we have a listmember who knows a couple who have been living together for around years he asks at what point did they stop fornicating and start being married i answer at the point if any where they both definitely and explicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other for better or worse as long as they both lived if they have accepted such an obligation what are their reasons for not being willing to declare it in front of say a justice of the peace yours james kiefer",1603

"from petri pihko subject re atheist s views on christianity was re accepting jeesus in your heart organization university of oulu finland lines jason smith wrote the discussion begins why does the universe exist at all one of the laws of nature specifying cause and effect seems to dictate at least to this layman s mind there must be a causal event no reasonable alternative exists i would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime causes precede their effects but if you claim that there must be an answer to how did the universe our spacetime emerge from nothing science has some good candidates for an answer i have always wondered why christians use the there are questions science or atheism can not answer argument i hope this is the appropriate group to ask this question the most popular question is the question of origins why does the universe exist or anything for that matter i think this question should actually be split into two parts namely why is there existence why anything exists and how did the universe emerge from nothing it is clear science has nothing to say about the first question however is it a meaningful question after all i would say it isn t consider the following a die hard skeptic being be it human or whatever attempts to doubt one s very existence since it is so easy to doubt everything else i can not be _sure_ the world exists it may be my mind fooling me can i ever be sure i exist however it is only possible to exist or not to exist someone insert an appropriate shakespeare quote here a being that does not exist can not doubt one s existence a being that does exist can doubt one s existence but this would be pointless the being would exist anyway let us return to the original question why a being that does not exist does not need any reasons for its non existence this being is not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind but let us assume that the world exists independent of the mind the objectivity postulate the question why anything exists can be countered by demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in nothingness or in non existence actually both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning things that exist do and things that don t exist don t exist tautology at its best i seriously doubt god could have an answer to this question some christians i have talked to have said that actually god is himself the existence however i see several problems with this answer first it inevitably leads to the conclusion that god is actually _all_ existence good and evil devils and angels us and them this is pantheism not christianity another answer is that god is the _source_ of all existence this sounds much better but i am tempted to ask does god himself exist then if god is the source of his own existence it can only mean that he has in terms of human time always existed but this is not the same as the source of all existence this argument sounds like god does not exist but meta exists and from his meta existent perspective he created existence i think this is actually a nonsolution a mere twist of words the best answer i have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions being an atheist myself i do not accept such answers since i do not have any other methods the second question how did the universe emerge from nothing belongs to the domain of science and i for one do not doubt the question can be answered by its methods many cosmologists have suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge from vacuum this possibility has been suggested in a recent hawking biography see also lizhi shuxian creation of the universe world scientific however i think the sci groups are more appropriate for discussions like this as far as i can tell the very laws of nature demand a why that isn t true of something outside of nature i e super natural this is not true science is a collection of models telling us how not why something happens i can not see any good reason why the why questions would be bound only to natural things assuming that the supernatural domain exists if supernatural beings exist it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist i believe the genetic code will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining reproducing life ever i ve never been much of a prophet though i can t even picture new york in my mind i don t believe any technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life despite having all of the parts available just my opinion this opinion is also called vitalism namely that living systems are somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems do christians in general adopt this position what would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life say small bacteria in a lab there is a problem with your prophecy artificial life has been created although not yet in a chemical form computer simulations of evolution contain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium although their code is electronic as well as their metabolism see a recent book steven levy artificial life the quest for a new creation jonathan cape london artificial chemical life is just around the corner after all no spark of life has been found to be necessary living systems do not violate any physical laws as we know them you don t mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your research do you after all if we of christ are deluding ourselves you really have nothing to worry about eh exactly this is why i think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical atheist arguments to soc religion groups since people who seek to find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together i would normally have asked these questions in alt atheism or talk religion misc but it seems many christians do not read these groups petri ___ petri pihko mathematics is

"from bill conner subject re soc motss et al princeton axes matching funds for boy scouts nntp posting host okcforum osrhe edu organization okcforum unix users group x newsreader tin version pl lines c wainwright wrote i jim i always thought that homophobe was only a word used at act up rallies i didn t beleive real people used it let s see if we agree on the term s definition a homophobe is one who actively and militantly attacks homosexuals because he is actually a latent homosexual who uses his hostility to conceal his true orientation since everyone who disapproves of or condemns homosexuality is a homophobe your implication is clear it must necessarily follow that all men are latent homosexuals or bisexual at the very least crap crap crap crap crap a definition of any type of phobe comes from phobia an irrational fear of hence a homophobe not only in act up meetings the word is apparently in general use now or perhaps it isn t in the bible wouldst thou prefer if i were to communicate with thou in bilespeak does an arachnophobe have an irrational fear of being a spider does an agoraphobe have an irrational fear of being a wide open space do you understand english obviously someone who has phobia will react to it they will do their best to avoid it and if that is not possible they will either strike out or run away or do gaybashings occur because of natural processes people who definately have homophobia will either run away from gay people or cause them or themselves violence isn t that what i said what are you taking issue with here your remarks are merely parenthetical to mine and add nothing useful it would seem odd if homosexuality had any evolutionary function other than limiting population growth since evolution only occurs when the members of one generation pass along their traits to subsequent generations homosexuality is an evolutionary deadend if i take your usage of the term homophobe in the sense you seem to intend then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our species at least is going nowhere so every time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children hmm no wonder the world is overpopulated obviously you keep to the monty python song every sperm is sacred and if as you say it has a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is by your own arguement natural consider the context i m talking about an evolutionary function one of the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a species procreate those who don t have no purpose in that context another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to survive the participation of both parents is necessary a family must exist since homosexuals do not reproduce they can not constitute a family since the majority of humankind is part of a family homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation contrary to nature if you will well if that is true by your own arguements homosexuals would have vanished years ago due to non procreation also the parent from single parent families should put the babies out in the cold now cos they must by your arguement die by your argument homosexuality is genetically determined as to your second point you prove again that you have no idea what context means i am talking about evolution the preservation of the species the fundamental premise of the whole process but it gets worse since the overwhelming majority of people actually prefer a heterosexual relationship homosexuality is a social abberation as well the homosexual eschews the biological imperative to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in the most fundamental social element the family but wait there s more read the above i expect you to have at least ten children by now with the family growing these days sex is less to do with procreation admittedly without it there would be no one but more to do with pleasure in pre pill and pre condom days if you had sex there was the chance of producing children these days is just ain t true people can decide whether or not to have children and when soon they will be able to choose it s sex c but that s another arguement so it s more of a lifestyle decision again by your arguement since homosexuals can not or choose not to reproduce they must be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children both are as unnatural as each other yet another non sequitur sex is an evolutionary function that exists for procreation that it is also recreation is incidental that homosexuals don t procreate means that sex is only recreation and nothing more they serve no evolutionary purpose since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some policy makers that they have civil rights they are now claiming that their sexuality is a preference a life style an orientation a choice that should be protected by law now if homosexuality is a mere choice and if it is both contrary to nature and anti social then it is a perverse choice they have even less credibility than before they became prominent people are people are people who are you to tell anyone else how to live their life are you god tm if so fancy a date here s pretty obvious dodge do you really think you ve said anything or do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement i am not telling anyone anything i am demonstrating that there are arguments against the practice of homosexuality providing it s a merely an alternate lifestlye that are not homophobic that one can reasonably call it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand i realize of course that this comes dangerously close to establishing a value and that atheists are compelled to object on that basis but if you are to be consistent you have no case in this regard to characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of the homosexual life style but since the charge is only intended to intimidate it s really just demogoguery and not to be taken seriously fact is jim there are far more persuasive arguments for suppressing homosexuality than those given but consider this a start again crap all your arguments are based on outdated ideals likewise the bible would any honest christian condemn the ten generations spawned by a bastard to eternal damnation or someone who crushes his penis either accidently or not both are in deuteronomy i m sure your comment pertains to something but you ve disguised it so well i can t see what where did i mention ideals out dated or otherwise your arguments are very reactionary do you have anything at all to contribute as to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in scouting the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from teaching by their own logic homosexuals are deviates social and biological since any adult is a role model for a child it is incumbent on the parent to ensure that the child be isolated from those who would do the child harm in this case harm means primarily social though that could be extended easily enough you show me anyone who has sex in a way that everyone would describe as normal and will take of my hat puma baseball cap to you one man s meat is another man s poison what has this got to do with anything would you pick a single point that you find offensive

"from david wagner subject re certainty and arrogance organization uh dept of math lines darren dr nancy s sweetie writes darren in an earlier article i explained that what many people find darren arrogant about christians is that some christians profess darren absolute certainty about their beliefs and doctrines and darren in short the problem is that no matter how good your sources darren are if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own darren thinking and reasoning then those doctrines are suspect the point that darren raises is a very lutheran viewpoint while reason is a gift from god it is also infected by sin yet we do not reject reason entirely and neither i think does darren we need reason as darren himself has pointed out to comprehend god s revelation of himself in the bible but reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the word we need first and foremost faith for the sinful mind is hostile to god it does not submit to god s law nor can it do so romans luther accepted scripture as the sole means of revelation sola scriptura but accepted the necessity of the use of reason with faith in comprehending that revelation yet luther also said regarding baptism but mad reason rushes forth and because baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do regards it as worthless large catechism fourth part baptism to make matters more complicated luther was the sort of theologian that many people would describe as an absolutist i ve seen him described as a take no prisoners theologian we might conclude given these observations that luther was inconsistent or mad and surely at least some have come to that conclusion but it might be useful to recall that jesus was also called mad and peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on pentecost so we as christians ought to be careful about rejecting luther or others as mad rather we should imitate the bereans who examined the scriptures every day to see if what paul said was true acts the basis for the confidence with which luther peter paul and many others preached the gospel was not just reason but faith and the holy spirit this is not faith divorced from reason but a faith that guides informs and uses reason the spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly god does not want us to preach the message that i think that jesus might have risen from the dead but rather i know that my redeemer lives job the christian does not side with pilate in saying what is truth but rather follows christ who said in fact for this reason i was born and for this i came into the world to testify to the truth everyone on the side of truth listens to me john we can know the truth because god has promised us that we can know the truth jesus said if you hold to my teachings you are really my disciples then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free john the proverbs urge us buy the truth and do not sell it pr the psalmist prayed do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth ps evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact in his mouth yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self glorification but if we present the truth as the teachings of scripture revealed by the spirit and not our own invention and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of scripture as luther did then we are not arrogant but humble we should humbly trust in god s promise of truth just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness rexlex it is only because of god s own revelation that we can be rexlex absolute about a thing darren but how far does that get you once god s revelation stops darren and your own reasoning begins possibility for error appears i agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of scripture and the products of our own reason even when such reasoning is based on scripture however i think i would draw the line of distinction more reasonably and less academically than you would darren for example let s suppose that our modern bible translations darren include a perfect rendering of jesus words at the last supper darren and that jesus said exactly this is my body darren we ll presume that what he said was totally without error and darren absolutely true what can we be certain of not much darren at the moment he stops speaking and people start darren interpreting the possibility of error appears did he mean darren that literally or not we do not have any record that he darren elaborated on the words was he thinking of tran or con darren substantiation he didn t say darren is almost at the point of making a very lutheran statement about the lord s supper the lutheran approach is to say that if jesus said this is my body then that is what we should believe other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in scripture recall that jesus words do not stand alone on this subject we also have paul s words in corinthians in which he passed on to us what he received from the lord in particular he said for whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the lord s death until he comes by these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the lord s supper really is bread as well as the lord s body as our senses in fact tell us does this prove that tran substantiation is false i suppose someone could say that paul spoke metaphorically of the lord s body as bread simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it but this thought is found nowhere in scripture so we reject it thus the primary reason for rejecting tran substantiation is not that we can prove it false but that it is simply not found in scripture side remark i ve been told that the lutheran doctrine on real presence is con substantiation but it has been non lutherans who have told me this we tend not to use the word i almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion who need labels to compare catholic lutheran and reformed teachings on the lord s supper but almost every church wants to call their own teaching real presence because that was the traditional teaching of the church end side remark darren when christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning darren can never lead them astray when we implicitly claim that we darren are infallible the non christians around us rarely believe darren that implicit claim witnessing is hardly going to work when darren the person you are talking to believes that you are either too darren foolish to recognise your own limits or intentionally trying darren to cover them up this is precisely why christians should not rely on rationalizations in their witnessing it is far better to take the approach i d like to show you what scripture says you decide for yourself whether to believe it or not darren rexlex suggested that people read _he is there and he is not darren silent_ by francis schaeffer i didn t think very highly of darren it but i think that mr schaeffer is grossly overrated by many darren evangelical christians somebody else might like it though darren so don t let my opinion stop you from reading it darren if someone is interested in my opinion i d suggest _on darren certainty_ by ludwig wittgenstein as long as we re trading references i d like to suggest dr siegbert becker s paperback the foolishness of god the place of reason in lutheran theology published by northwestern publishing house this book was based on becker s doctoral thesis at the university of chicago david wagner not by might nor by power a confessional lutheran but by my spirit says the lord almighty zechariah",1642

"from charles brasted subject re some thoughts organization the university of adelaide lines distribution world nntp posting host adelphi itd adelaide edu au keywords dan bissell dan lawrence bissell writes first i want to start right out and say that i m a christian it makes sense to be one have any of you read tony campollo s book liar lunatic or the real thing i might be a little off on the title but he writes the book anyway he was part of an effort to destroy christianity in the process he became a christian himself i assume you are posting to encourage comments how much history has tony campello read not much it seems the arguements he uses i am summing up the book is about whether jesus was god or not i know many of you don t believe but listen to a different perspective for we all have something to gain by listening to what others have to say it is good to hear that there are a few reasonable christians about if only those christian scientists would take note in australia there is a very strong movement a bunch of christian scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true and that there is a rational explanation for it all that can be justified by using the laws of physics for example there are a few chaps who are trying to prove that the age of the universe is years old and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed light has been rapidly decaying over the years and this has not been accounted for the book says that jesus was either a liar or he was crazy a modern day koresh or he was actually who he said he was or of course that he never existed and the bible was a story and was never intended to become a manifesto for a billion people did tony follow that one up some reasons why he wouldn t be a liar are as follows who would die for a lie wouldn t people be able to tell if he was a liar people gathered around him and kept doing it many gathered from hearing or seeing someone who was or had been healed millions of people have died for a lie this point is difficult to substantiate since it is not well defined a great many religious arguments work in that way but consider the many aztec warriors who sacrificed themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the spanish invaders the list is endless the aztecs lost btw call me a fool but i believe he did heal people that is perfectly reasonable but it is not grounds for me or anyone to become a christian more to the point it does not add weight to the claim that jesus was the real thing niether was he a lunatic would more than an entire nation be drawn to someone who was crazy very doubtful in fact rediculous for example anyone who is drawn to david koresh is obviously a fool logical people see this right away have you ever seen a documentary about the rise of nazi germany more to the point did tony mention this one could hardly call werner heisenberg and his many colleagues fools or illogical men their support of hitler was based i presume upon an emotional issue rather than a rational agreement with his principles obviously my argument is invalid if tony thought that hitler was sane therefore since he wasn t a liar or a lunatic he must have been the real thing hmmm i don t think his arguments warrant the use of a therefore some other things to note he fulfilled loads of prophecies in the psalms isaiah and elsewhere in hrs alone this in his betrayal and crucifixion i don t have my bible with me at this moment next time i write i will use it this is unfortunately what alot of religious discussions i have had with people result in quoting the bible the only reasonable way i think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present if someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally he or she will end up in all sorts of shit tony s argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place but to convince someone who thinks the bible is total fiction that jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless for example in mathematics you can not say a is equal to b because a is equal to b i don t think most people understand what a christian is that would possibly explain why there have so many people being killed in religious wars and why there are hundreds of different versions all claiming to be correct it is certainly not what i see a lot in churches rather i think it should be a way of life and a total sacrafice of everything for god s sake he loved us enough to die and save us so we should do the same hey we can t do it god himself inspires us to turn our lives over to him that s tuff and most people don t want to do it to be a real christian would be something for the strong to persevere at but just like weight lifting or guitar playing drums whatever it takes time we don t rush it in one day christianity is your whole life it is not going to church once a week or helping poor people once in a while we box everything into time units such as work at this time sports tv social life god is above these boxes and should be carried with us into all these boxes that we have created for ourselves i think if you posted this part to alt religion you would get more flames than here i have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of a stranger should be of interest to other people someone famous said that there two evils in life polititians and churchs one rules by fear of the living the other by fear of the dead if i am pressed i could probably find the exact quotation cheers charles",1647

molecular biology for computer scientists prof mick noordewier rutgers university this overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain material covered will include structural and informational molecules the basic organization of the cell and of genetic material the central dogma of gene expression and selected other topics in the area of structure function and regulation as relates to current computational approaches dr noordewier has appointments in both computer science and biology at rutgers and has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition to his current work in computational biology pm introduction to artificial intelligence for biologists dr richard lathrop mit arris corp an overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be presented as it relates to actual and potential biological applications fundamental techniques symbolic programming languages and notions of search will be discussed as well as selected topics in somewhat greater detail such as knowledge representation inference and machine learning the intended audience includes biologists with some computational background but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence dr lathrop co developer of ariadne and related technologies has worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to biological problems in both academia and industry pm neural networks statistics and information theory in biological sequence analysis dr alan lapedes los alamos national laboratory this tutorial will cover the most rapidly expanding facet of intelligent systems for molecular biology that of machine learning techniques applied to sequence analysis closely interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general characteristics of sequences and the relationship of such approaches to statistical techniques and information theoretic views of sequence data dr lapedes of the theoretical division at los alamos has long been a leader in the use of such techniques in this domain pm genetic algorithms and genetic programming prof john koza stanford university the genetic algorithm an increasingly popular approach to highly non linear multi dimensional optimization problems was originally inspired by a biological metaphor this tutorial will cover both the biological motivations and the actual implementation and characteristics of the algorithm genetic programming an extension well suited to problems where the discovery of the size and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem will also be addressed particular attention will be paid to biological applications and to identifying resources and software that will permit attendees to begin using the methods dr koza a consulting professor of computer science at stanford has taught this subject since and is the author of a standard text in the field pm linguistic methods in sequence analysis prof david searls university of pennsylvania shmuel pietrokovski weizmann institute approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies are increasingly in evidence these involve the adaptation of tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic pattern recognition and gene prediction the classification of genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory the identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes in sequence data and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and functional relatedness dr searls who holds research faculty appointments in both genetics and computer science at penn represents the branch of this field that considers higher order syntactic approaches to sequence data while shmuel pietrokovski has studied and published with prof edward trifinov in the area of word based analyses

"from darius_lecointe subject re sabbath admissions of organization florida state university lines someone sent me this faq by e mail and i post my response here i m not enforcing the inclusion limits on this faq because most of our readers probably haven t seen it clh christ warns that anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches otheres to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven matt this faq is so full of error that i must respond to it i hope that whoever maintains will remove from it the partisan theology brothers and sisters being new to the faith and examining the decalogue closely i ve noticed the fourth commandment is pretty specific about keeping the sabbath day it states the th day saturday is the sabbath while most christian religions keep or atleast go to church on sunday what s up this is a frequently asked question every time it arises it causes months of debate so let me see if i can answer you directly basically it s because the law was given to moses as part of a specific covenanent with the jews most of us aren t jews so we aren t part of that covenant there was an argument early in christian history about whether the mosaic laws should apply to gentiles who became christians you can see the account of this debate in acts the main question there was circumcision but keeping the sabbath would be part of it as well the apostles concluded that we need not become jews in order to become christians and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us the law was known to man before it was revealed on mount sinai rom notes that where no law is there is no transgression not only did sin exist before sinai eden but the sabbath was kept before it was revealed on sinai ex the problem with the first covenant was not the law but the promise which undergirded it god wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people but in their ignorance after years of slavery they promised what ever he says to do we will do that is why the new covenant is based on better promises heb rather than do away with the law god promised to put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts heb including the sabbath in the acts is selective inclusion the sabbath was more important to the jews than circumcision if any attempt had been made to do away with the sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in acts do not confuse the weekly sabbath of the decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law ceremonial which was added because of transgression of the moral law gal israel stands for god s people of all time that is why god grafted the gentiles in roma says that the adoption the glory the covenants the giving of the law the service of god and the promises belong to israelites in explanation paul makes it clear that being born into israel is not enough for they are not all israel which are of israel v then in gal he says if ye be christ s then are ye abraham s seed and heirs according to the promise all christians are abraham s seed jews israelites not physically for that is not the criterion but spiritually we are joint heirs with jesus based on the promise god made to all his people the israelites while christians agree that the ot laws do not all apply to us because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the jews we also expect to see some similarity between the things god expected from the jews and the things he expects from us after all it s the same god however there are several ways of dealing with this these days the most common approach is to separate the ot commandments into moral and ceremonial ceremonial commandments apply only to the jews they are part of the specific mosaic covenant these are thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision moral laws apply to everyone most of the commands are part of the moral law except for the commandment about the sabbath i believe most people who take this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on the sabbath is part of the ceremonial law but a general obligation to worship regularly is part of the general moral law thus christians are free to choose the specific time we worship people would probably agree but they are wrong how can the sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws you are not free to choose your time of worship even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship would you rather give up a day which god blessed sanctified and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation see sabbath admissions in soc religion christian bible study a more radical approach which is generally connected with john calvin and the reformed tradition says that the law as a whole is no longer binding instead we are entirely under grace and our behavior should be guided solely by love portions of the ot law are still useful as guidance but they are not properly speaking legally binding on us in practice most people who take this position do not believe it is safe to leave christians without moral guidannce while we may no longer be under law as sinners it s not safe for us to go into situations with no principles to guide us we re too good at self justification for that to be safe thus christians do have moral guidance from things like jesus teachings paul s advice etc these may not be precisely a law but they serve much the same function as and have largely the same content as the moral law in the previous analysis while calvin would deny that we have a fixed legal responsibility to worship on any specific day he would say that given human weakness the discipline of regular worship is important i do not care what calvin or any theologian says my guide is what god says if being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the sabbath commandment which is the only one god thought was important enough to say remember if you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of god if a cop pulls me over for speeding then in court i ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace do i walk out of the court saying i can now go on speeding for i am now under grace being under grace i now drive within the speed limit paul adds to it in rom di we then make void the law through faith god forbid yea we establish the law wherefore the law is holy and the commandment holy and just and good rom in both analyses the specific day is not an issue as a matter of tradition we worship on sunday as a memorial of christ s resurrection there s some debate about what acts shows about early christian worship the most common analysis is that is shows jewish christians continuing to go to jewish services on the sabbath but that specifically christian service were not necessarily held then act shows worship on the first day sunday and i cor also implies gatherings on that day there are a few groups that continue to believe christians have to worship on the sabbath saturday the best known are the seventh day adventists and jehovah s witnesses they argue that act is not a regular worship service but a special meeting to see paul off and that i cor doesn t explicitly say it s a regular worship service do you prefer implication to fact a careful study of the acts shows that the meeting was on saturday night and that on sunday morning paul did not go to a worship service but set off on a long journey by foot to assos in icor there is no way you can equate lay by him in store with go to a worship service it s clear that this issue was a contested one in paul s time see rom paul s advice is that we should be very careful about judging each other on issues like this one person sees a specific day as mandated by god while another does not he who observes that specific day does it in honor of the lord he who believes his worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the lord those who believe that the sabbath is still mandated argue that paul is not referring to sabbath worship here note however col which says something similar but briefer it explicitly mentions sabbath wrong these are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law not the sabbath day of the moral law there are some differences among christians about use of the word sabbath originally the term referred to the th day the jewish day of worship many christians now use it to refer to sunday the day of christian worship they do this largely so that they can apply the th or whatever there are a couple of different numbering schemes commandment to it reformed tradition does not do this it distinguishes between the sabbath which is the observance mandated for jews and the lord s day which is the free christian worship the only reference i can find to this in the nt is rev there are also differences about laws regarding this day many christians support blue laws both in secular law and church law setting aside that day and causing people to spend it in worship the more radical anti legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the jewish sabbath which is not appropriate to the free christian worship of the lord s day why would you prefer to twist and turn relying on different arguments which conflict with each other rather than obey a simple request from a god who loved you enough to die for you jesus died because the law could not be changed why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable that is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws it will always be a sin to make false gods to violate god s name to break the sabbath to steal to kill etc except it you disagree but then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of god darius it s not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq i think paul s comments on esteeming one day over another rom is probably all that needs to be said i accept that darius is doing what he does in honor of the lord i just wish he might equally accept that those who esteem all days alike are similarly doing their best to honor the lord however i d like to be clear that i do not think there s unambiguous proof that regular christian worship was on the first day as i indicated there are responses on both of the passages cited the difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else they both look like they are talking about nnregular christian meetings but neither explicitly says and they gathered every sunday for worship we get various pieces of information but nothing aimed at answering this question act describes christians as participating both in jewish temple worship and in christian communion services in homes obviously the temple worship is on the sabbath acts is an example of christians participating in them unfortunately it doesn t tell us what day christians met in their houses acts despite darius confusion is described by acts as occuring on sunday i see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start when the biblical text is clear about what was meant the wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting it doesn t say they gathered to see paul off but that when they were gathered for breaking bread paul talked about his upcoming travel but that s just not explicit enough to be really convincing similarly with cor it says that on the first day they should set aside money for paul s collection now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this or that they did it in their homes i can t disprove it but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day so i think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day of every week simply means every time they gather for worship i think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christian worship was clh",1666

"from russell turpin subject re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition organization cs dept university of texas at austin lines distribution inet nntp posting host imu cs utexas edu summary more in response to lee lady keywords science errors turpin nlp i think that part of the problem is that i have proposed a definition of science that i intended to be interpreted broadly and that lee lady has interpreted fairly narrowly my definition is this science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous work lee lady writes i don t think that science should be defined in a way that some of the activities that lead to really important science namely thinking and informal exploration are not recognized as scientific work unless one classifies thinking and informal exploration as a mistake they fall under my definition i hope no one would consider speculation thinking and informal exploration as unscientific in article lee lady writes seriously i m not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes here is where i think we are talking at cross purposes it is not clear to me that the kind of definition i have proposed should be taken as describing what science is mainly about consider for example a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone this fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about one can read this definition and still not know that of all animal species are invertebrates that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form that some invertebrate groups such as insects and nematodes are ubiquitous in all ecosystems etc in short knowing the definition of invertebrates does not tell one what they are mainly about the misunderstanding here is my fault i did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition okay so let s see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that a treatment is useful secondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i agree on both counts as an example of the second it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective despite a lack of controls as to the first i do not think it is useful to talk about absolute scientific truth i think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence in particular fields that in the past have proven faulty or reliable the latter is obviously a matter of degree and in each field practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence one of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others it is perfectly alright to speculate i have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right but the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative to list what little evidence was presently available for them and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work it is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail the folks over in sci psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since they re not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance i think a lot of scientists steer away from things that deserving or not garner a patina of kookiness when proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice that sets alarms ringing in many researchers minds this is unfortunate because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy on the other hand i can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research as gordon banks has pointed out no one wants to become this generation s rhine one academic in sci psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn t been described in a scientific journal i think this is absurd actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but it s apparently not acceptable because it s a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal i wonder why the results were not published in my field dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished this certainly eases one s defense finally i hope lee lady will forgive me from commenting either on nlp or the discussion of it in sci psychology i know little about either and so have nothing to offer russell",1692

the hewlett packard scanners when initially bringing up the software it lets you select several options text graphics input source ie scanner fax file disk file automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image i like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which parts of the document i would like scanned and in what order once an image is scanned you can bring up the pop up image verification the software gives you two errors at this point blue which are words that were converted reliability but do not match anything in the built in dictionary yellow shade which are words that wordscan plus doesn t think it converted correctly at all i have found that the software should give itself more credit it is usually correct instead of wrong if a word is shaded blue you can add it to your personal dictionary the only problem is the personal dictionary will only handle about words i find this to be very limited considering how many medical terms are not in a

problem infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the united states since the early s the u s public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes e g escherichia coli o h hepatitis c virus human immunodeficiency virus legionnaires disease lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis tb have increased in many areas furthermore control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal disease salmonellosis shigellosis tb and staphylococcal infections emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons those in institutional settings e g hospitals and child day care centers and minority and underserved populations the substantial economic burden of emerging

restaurants in washington linked with cases primarily were serving regular sized hamburger patties produced on november some of the same meat was used in jumbo patties produced on november the

center for infectious diseases cdc editorial note e coli o h is a pathogenic gram negative bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers this pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hus the most common cause of acute renal failure in children outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef although other food vehicles including roast beef raw milk and apple cider also have been implicated preliminary data from a cdc year nationwide multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for e coli o h that organism was isolated more frequently than shigella in four of participating hospitals and was isolated from of all bloody stools a higher rate than for any other pathogen infection with e coli o h often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april smac medium and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection the usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea often bloody and abdominal cramps fever is infrequent younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications illness usually resolves after days but of patients develop hus which is characterized by hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia renal failure and a death rate of this report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of e coli o h in the absence of routine surveillance despite the magnitude of this outbreak the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in washington clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or hus for e coli o h using smac agar when infections with e coli o h are identified they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and if necessary public health action to prevent further cases e coli o h lives in the intestines of healthy cattle and can contaminate meat during slaughter cdc is collaborating with the u s department of agriculture s food safety inspection service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as e coli o h entering the meat supply because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated the optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink and the juices are clear in this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role the food and drug administration fda has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to f c fda personal communication regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks the public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by e coli o h and for hus to better define the epidemiology of e coli

and virility use of oral snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players encouraging this behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for nicotine addiction oral cancer and other mouth disorders differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among racial ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require further explanation for example targeted marketing practices may play a role in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups and affecting the differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons in this report one concern is that nearly one fourth of current smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes in the

the year have established special population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use including males aged years to no more than by the year objective and american indian alaskan native youth to no more than by the year objective a strategies to lower the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless tobacco use integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco control efforts enforcing laws that restrict minors access to tobacco making excise taxes commensurate with those on cigarettes encouraging health care providers to

swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of god his arguments which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late th century western christian

includes an appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut mackie j l mackie the miracle of theism oxford this posthumous volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of god it ranges from the classical philosophical positions of descartes anselm berkeley hume et al through the moral arguments of newman kant and sidgwick to the recent restatements of the classical theses by plantinga and swinburne it also addresses those positions which push the concept of god beyond the realm of the rational such as those of kierkegaard

think to be the religion and that this is not exactly the same coming from different people within the religion there is nothing with there existing different perspectives within the religion perhaps one can say that they tend to converge on the truth my point is that they are doing a lot of harm on the way in the meantime and that they converge is counterfactual religions appear to split and diverge even when there might be a true religion at the core the layers above determine what happens in practise and they are quite inhumane usually what you post then is supposed to be an answer but i don t see what is has got to do with what i say i will repeat it religions as are harm people and religions don t converge they split giving more to disagree upon and there is a lot of disagreement to whom one should be tolerant or if one should be tolerant at all ideologies also split giving more to disagree upon and may also lead to intolerance so do you also oppose all ideologies i don t think your argument is an argument against religion at all but just points out the weaknesses of human nature big deletion do women have souls in islam people have said here that some muslims say that women do not have souls i must admit i have never heard of such a view being held by muslims of any era i have heard of some christians of some eras holding this viewpoint but not muslims are you sure you might not be confusing christian history with islamic history yes it is supposed to have been a predominant view in the turkish caliphate i would like a reference if you have got one for this is news to me anyhow that women are the spiritual equals of men can be clearly shown from many verses of the qur an for example the qur an says for muslim men and women for believing men and women for devout men and women for true men and women for men and women who are patient and constant for men and women who humble themselves for men and women who give in charity for men and women who fast and deny themselves for men and women who guard their chastity and for men and women who engage much in god s praise for them has god prepared forgiveness and a great reward qur an abdullah yusuf ali s translation there are other quotes too but i think the above quote shows that men and women are spiritual equals and thus that women have souls just as men do very clearly no it does not it implies that they have souls but it does not say they have souls and it is not given that the quote above is given a high priority in all interpretations one must approach the qur an with intelligence any thinking approach to the qur an can not but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals i think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven or to have a great reward understood to be in the after life i think the usual answer would be no in which case the part saying for them has god prepared forgiveness and a great reward says they have souls if it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven then i have no idea _what_ a soul is as for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations any thinking approach to the qur an has to give all verses of the qur an equal priority that is because according to muslim belief the _whole_ qur an is the revelation of god in fact denying the truth of any part of the qur an is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in islam quite similar to you other post even when the quran does not encourage slavery it is not justified to say that iit forbids or puts an end to slavery it is a non sequitur look any approach to the qur an must be done with intelligence and thought it is in this fashion that one can try to understand the quran s message in a book of finite length it can not explicitly answer every question you want to put to it but through its teachings it can guide you i think however that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse and that since women can clearly be forgiven and rewarded they _must_ have souls from the above verse let s try to understand what the qur an is trying to teach rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage the misinterpretations of the qur an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite but the interpretations fully consistent are more limited let s try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit for that is just showing how people can try to twist islam for their own ends something i do not deny but provides no reflection on the true teachings of islam whatsoever fred rice",1766

"from hal f lillywhite subject re ancient books organization tektronix inc beaverton or lines i sent in something on this before but i believe it got lost in the weekend accident the moderator described this is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time hl the standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents is probably the writing of friedrich blass hermeneutrik und kritik _einleitende und hilfsdisziplinen_ vol of _handbuch der klassischen altertums wissenshaft_ noerdlingen beck portions of this are described in nibley _the prophetic book op mormon_ pp slc deseret book if you want to attempt reading this be forewarned nibley describes blass as a typical german scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader nibley s extract from blass s work is in the form of rules for forgers it makes interesting reading i confess that i have not read blass s work only nibley s extract thereof my german falls far short of what would be required and as far as i know there is no english translation available however i believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame we will not be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and culture or is a later forgery actually there are types of purportedly ancient documents alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof for example the dead sea scrolls these can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper inks and objects found with them this can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent for example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago perhaps even having been through several generations of copists this is more of a problem but can still be tested although the test is not likely to be simple we can not expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself it is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be they can only date the document and identify its culture of origin for example i ve heard of a letter supposed to have been written by jesus himself to a king in what is now iraq if this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink assuming they have the holograph they could check the language content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a palestinian jew of that time however even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if jesus himself actually wrote it we would know what time and culture it came from but barring a known sample of jesus handwriting or other clues for comparison scholarship must stop there there is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was as i say i m no expert on blas s work i do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works specifically we might ask is the document internally consistent does it contradict itself if the work it is short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency even if it is a forgery the longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency for this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents is it consistent with the history and geography of the time again a short non specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter day forger would be able to escape detection here we look for the minor inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check the devil is in the details what about the literary style of the work figures of speech etc any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that seem strange to us are there any such odd phrases in this book if so do they fit in with the culture of course there are complications if the document has been translated or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it a few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies they cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but don t necessarily prove forgery these tests can be quite effective given enough material to work with but they are not easy they require the skills of the historian the linguist the anthropologist etc the questions to ask are is every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin if there are things which don t fit how significant are they are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge later changes by copists or are they really significant there will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture the end result of any such testing is occasionally certain particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies however often it may just be a probability or an indication that the document or maybe parts of it is probably authentic or sometimes maybe other parts are later additions this is often unsettling to a generation raised on tv where all problems are solved in to minutes with time out for commercials it is however the real world and what scholarship has to offer",1781

"from larry l overacker subject re the arrogance of christians organization shell oil lines in article carol alvin writes virgilio dean b velasco jr writes in article carol alvin writes are all truths also absolutes is all of scripture truths and therefore absolutes the answer to both questions is yes perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then to me an absolute is something that is constant across time culture situations etc true in every instance possible do you agree with this definition i think you do similarly all truth is absolute indeed a non absolute truth is a contradiction in terms when is something absolute when it is always true obviously if a truth is not always true then we have a contradiction in terms i agree with carol here determining absolutes is practically speaking a waste of time and we easily forget that relative truth is in fact relative for example i recently was asking some children the question what temperature does water boil at i got the answer degrees consistently i asked if they knew what scale and was told it s just degrees any scale that s what all thermometers say well that s sincere and may be true in the experience of the speaker but it is simply wrong it is not an absolute truth similarly scripture is full of truth which we should nurture and cherish but trying to determine which parts are absolute truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point then religion easily becomes an intellectual head trip devoid of the living experience of the indwelling trinity and becomes dead scholasticism imo example of head covering in church deleted this was a good example there may be an absolute truth behind the writing but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the corinthians and not necessarily elsewhere the instructions may reflect absolute truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at corinth which was having a lot of trouble with order is it absolute truth to me no and i see no compelling or even reasonable reason that it should be evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth and there are plenty of other examples can you reconcile this even the most die hard literalists do not take all of the bible literally i ve yet to meet anyone who takes the verse blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks literally the bible was not printed or handed to us by god with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world such a statement is terribly self contradictory let me put it to you this way if there are no absolutes shouldn t we conclude that the statement there are no absolutes is not absolutely true obviously we have a contradiction here i don t claim that there are no absolutes i think there are very few though and determining absolutes is difficult i agree very few and even if we knew them personally we may not be able to express that in a way that still conveys absolute truth to another the presence of absence of absolutes may not make any difference since i know i can never fully apprehend an absolute if it walks up and greets me there is hardly consensus even in evangelical christianity not to mention the rest of christianity regarding biblical interpretation so people sometimes disagree about what is true this does not negate the fact however that there are still absolutes in the universe i can t prove the existence of absolutes i can only rely upon my experience i also trust god s revelation that we can not fully comprehend the infinite therefore we can t comprehend the absolutes so i don t need them i can never know the essence of god only the energies by and through which god is manifested to god s creation so the reality can be that there are absolutes but it is of no practical importance it s like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect but copies may not be swell who cares it doesn t affect me in any practical useful way i might as well believe that god has made a lot of electric blue chickens and that they live on mars maybe god did so what is that going to have any effect on how i deal with my neighbor or god whether or not i go to this or that cafeteria for lunch no this attitude leads many non christians to believe that all christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning christianity is true wonderful and sensible it appeals to reason since reason is an inner reflection of the logos of god explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world note i m not claiming there is no place for authority that d be silly there is a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that and is generally agressive good parents like god are authoritative many christians are simply

"subject re biblical rape from benedikt rosenau organization technical university braunschweig germany lines in article rob strom writes deletion the thread biblical rape was initiated by david o hunt here is his posting in article david o hunt writes i m pretty sure i ve seen biblical rules for when it s allowable to rape prisoners what the codes are about that etc could some more knowledgable soul than i please let me know some references he asked a very narrow question and i gave a very narrow answer yes sorry i have got that wrong my apology deletion no david hunt s post didn t mention a god nor did my response you were the first to bring up the idea of the bible being given by god most jews don t believe this in any literal sense so no fun but i must have met the minority then and given by god refers to any action whereby a god god causes or better effects something rob i am not intimate with jewish theology but i understand that you are a messianic jew correct me if i am wrong but it appears that the views of messianic jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of jews while jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the christianic god views i have heard that it is possible for jews to attribute evil to their god an no no for christians the bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man deletion no i thought we agreed that though jews disagree there are a set of core beliefs that they do agree upon one of which is that the commandments are accessible and written in the language of the time and another of which is that there must be a legal system to update them the context was metaphysics even when the process of adapting the commandments is not transcendent the justification of the process lie in metaphysic specualtion i wonder how you break out of the shackles of having metaphysics in your system deletion could you explain this with respect to the original commandments being discussed that is the commandment that says if you feel like raping a woman prisoner you should instead wait and marry her what about the way this commandment is given invalidates it is is in a book that commands to commit genocide among other reprehensible deeds the context is repulsive and it is foul play imo to invoke some relatively enlightened passages as an example for the content of the whole book big deletion the point is that i see that there is a necessary connection between the theology you use and the interpretation of the bible only very loosely my interpretation of the bible is based on a long tradition of jewish scholars interpreting the bible theology doesn t really enter into it there are jewish atheists who interpret the laws of charity essentially the same way i do no not the interpretation of some laws but the interpretation of the bible as in the example that sodom and gomorrha mean argue with god the whole idea that it is metaphorically and yet allows you to argue with a god whatever that means that alone is a theo logic question is proof of a theology used you pose another metaphysical riddle no you do well you wrote this fine so we have some major spirit with neither absolute power nor absolute knowledge and as it appears limited means or will to communicate with us some form of spiritual big friend do you admit that using god in this context is somewhat unusual am i right in the assumption that it can not have created the universe as well and that the passages in the bible referring to that or its omnipotence are crap that s what i meant by the riddle it is an important question in the light of what for instance the passage witrh sodom and gomorrha means either there is some connection between the text the fact that it exists and your interpretation of it or it is purely arbitrary further the question is why is has one to carry the burden of biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better you might answer that one can t becuase some peculiar biblical information might be lost but that holds true of every other book and the question remains why has the bible still a special place can t it be replaced somehow is it ok to bargain the dangerous content of the bible against some other message that is included as well deletion do you see the danger in doing so especially with the metaphers used in the bible i think the danger of doing so is less than either the danger of having a frozen system of laws or having no laws sorry but there are worse systems does not say anything about if one could not have a better system deletion if we read two stories about the importance of helping the poor and in one god is a spirit and in the other god has a body which is more important helping the poor or resolving the contradiction about the corporeal nature of god if we read two stories in the bible one that god commands people to kill children for being idolaters and another where god kills children directly what is more important to resolve the message that children are to be killed or if it has to be done by god and the argument you have given is a fallacy while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not it can be crucial in other questions religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god one can not resolve questions by the statement do what is good when what is good depends on the question benedikt",1859

"from gerry palo subject re athiests and hell lines in article writes in article gerry palo writes note that in this perhaps the oldest of the creeds there is no mention of the danger of hell for non believers likewise there is no mention of the salvation of the believers soul and its destiny in heaven after death there is only the resurrection of the body and it does not say when or how you don t go far enough back if we believe in god and that he did create the heavens and the earth and he did create adam and eve and that they walked in the garden and history flowed from there if we can agree with that then would you agree that the further back you go the closer you get to people who had a stronger memory of who god was and what he said and commanded between adam and eve and golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occurred this involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world this is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through history the greek for example could say better a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead iliad i think the question of what happens to human beings who died before christ is an ever present one with christians i am not ready to conscign adam or abraham or even cain to eternal damnation yet they all died in their sins in the christian sense the same can be said of the whole of gentile humanity and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him i do not limit the power of christ to save even him through whom satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment in my studies of the ancient mystery reliegions i have run across many poems or rituals or what nots with the interpretation that those who are of god will be with him via the promised seed but those who rebel will suffer eternal life in dieing it was a standard belief back then it is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment the relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of greenwich mean time it is possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss or even many of them in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth it was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost this again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that fled from us after the fall with our ever increasing involvement with the sense world it would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people s ideas of life after death today we think we know so much and that if we could go back in time we could sure teach those people a thing or two but i think that as this age has grown older that it is we who opperate from a mist not those of the older ages mankind fell into mist and darkness and at the turning point of time a new light entered into the world the light still grows and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it much new revelation and growth in under standing lies before us our new vision and understanding is still very feeble but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well at this point i should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of rudolf steiner founder of anthroposophy for many insights that have led me to my views on this subject i have said it before i d love to post on this but the vulcan hammer would fall the history to purgatory can be shown from the druids in england to the greeks who pilaged it from the egyptians who ultimately got it from the babylonian mysteries and yes the eastern religions also show many similarities i mean its black and white the writings and the archeological finds plainly show its origin and the whys and wherefores of this doctine the way you refer to it as doctrine puts a modern intellectual coloring on it i think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received i am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source even if they were passed on the question is to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience the similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people s ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality in any case we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of euclid but by contemplating the principles themselves on the other hand there is one notion firmly embedded in christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source the idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only and that the soul is created at birth was consciously adopted from aristotle whose ideas dominated christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today he was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim maybe at sometime in the future indeed i should also clarify that i do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is a real possibility but the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment i e after the end of a single earthly life is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality and i think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out rex gerry",1886

"from paul halsall subject catholic liturgy reply to organization j random misconfigured site lines the problems with catholic liturgy are likely to continue for some time the problem is in a nutshell this the liturgy is a symbolic action in other words catholics do or should believe that the _signs_ during the mass water blessings vestments altar relics etc are real that is the sprinkling of water bestows real almost tangible holiness the vestments are a real indication of real sacred time the point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying real referent this kind of thinking precludes analysis holy water is not holy because of anything it simply is holy but modern westerners find it extremely difficult especially if well educated to think of the mass as a symbol we are more likely to see it as a _sign_ ie an action that represents grace but which could be replaced with other signs in concrete terms this means the mass has become a commercial for god s grace rather than the real thing you can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn t dare with the real thing ask coca cola co these attitudes have been encouraged by liturgy workshops etc which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy you can only create signs symbols have to come from god or the heart or somewhere deeper than analysis the most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species the consecrated host and wine now with pita bread etc it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles if the host is a sign of grace this isnt and issue but catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of jesus body modern catholic liturgy is caught in this epistemological shift we try to perfrom the old rites but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and explain what we are doing so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it this is not a soul filling experience it doesn t help btw that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz folk music again a result of mis analysis complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones this was the genius of wesley and the c anglican hymn writers taize is only slightly better what are we to do well i suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesn t work for you search out a church where the liturgy is well prepared not well explained they exist in every city this is not btw a matter of particular style the music might be old or new it is the attitude of the church that counts also note that a conservative liturgy harking back to pre vatican ii days does not necessarily mean the church will be socially conservative in nyc i can recommend corpus christi w st st corpus christi w st st very conservative liturgy st joseph s greenwich village modern clean largely gay oratorian church brooklyn very beautiful avoid anywhere anytime a church with electric candles happy easter christos aneste christos voskrezhne christ is risen paul halsall",1888

"from joseph dale fisher subject re unity organization indiana university lines in article maarten van loon writes hello fellow netters and fellow christians about the subject of unity between christians and christian churches to a bible study group alltough i do have a personal opinion on this issue i thought it would be nice to hear opinions of fellow christian brothers and sisters from different countries and in different situations my background member of a orthodox reformed church let us say a little the only unity i ve found which is true is when all parties involved are disciples i came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages while none of them put anything into practice from those messages since becoming a disciple i ve found that when i travel to another church in the same movement they are just as accepting there as any other we had a retreat back in january when some of the congregation from louisville ky came up this retreat was for college students and it was as though i had known even the people from louisville for years and i had only become a disciple the previous april and had never been to the church in kentucky one of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self sacrifice that is only one area in which disciples stand out from christians also another part of unity is a common depth of conviction i ve also been a part of some christian campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved a lack of conviction about everything they believed that was why they could be unified they didn t care about the truth but delighted in getting along together the problem here in the netherlands is that there are two other churches denominations with the same characteristics both have the same confessions there are only some differences with respect to for example the matter of appropriation of salvation and how to use our creeds in essence a lot of people of these three churches have to same faith and feel that they should become one church but how that is the question creeds what need is there of creeds when the bible stands firmly better so here is a first question can the congregation of christ be separated by walls of different denominations or is this definitely an untolerable situation according to the scriptures according to the scriptures splits and differences of opinion are going to be there as per a previous note i mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means there are also differences of opinion and belief however scripture states in the following directives i have no praise for you for your meetings do more harm than good in the first place i hear that when you come together as a church there re divisions among you and to some extent i believe it no doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have god s approval corinthians how will god show his approval by fruitfulness see acts but before that there are these qualities devotion to the apostles teaching fellowship communion filling with awe for god all having everything in common glad and sincere hearts praising god enjoying the favor of the people all these are mentioned in acts god also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted look at stephen a man full of faith and of the holy spirit acts who was later stoned acts can one say that only one of these three churches is the true church of jesus christ one can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement i have yet to find that but the closest one i ve found is the boston church of christ movement which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected it is also the only one i ve seen which is totally sold out to god a problem closely related to these question is can we cooperate with other christians from these two churches before there is a unity this question is especially important for those who think that only one church can be the true one as for cooperation that can always occur unity on the other hand may never occur as for those who think about only one church being the true one i remind them that mark states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with but they will not lose their reward as with the boston movement i ve heard numerous times this exact same thing that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples of course few people admit that they ve ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement i know i haven t maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you for your information we have a lot of organizations here which are founded by people of one specific church and whose members are all members of that church this has been considered as correct for years only a few years ago people started to discuss about this and now we are in the middle of this process some organizations are opening their doors for people from other churches etc i must warn that this sounds cliquey to me a clique is a group which runs around together to some extent exclusively this causes problems in fellowship and causes divisions i would not say at all that this is something correct for a church group to do for any reason in one of the churches i attended for example there was an internal clique of people who were on the different groups committees organizational heads of the congregation they rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being opened up so that they would have to step right back in their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch i wish he would ve since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple anyway this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down but is still there so i must warn against such division within there s enough division without thanks for your opinions in advance maarten joe fisher",1952

"from kenneth alvin subject re certainty and arrogance organization university of colorado boulder lines in article dr nancy s sweetie writes dean velasco quoted a letter from james m stowell president of moody bible institute we affirm the absolutes of scripture not because we are arrogant moralists but because we believe in god who is truth who has revealed his truth in his word and therefore we hold as precious the strategic importance of those absolutes there has been a lot of discussion but so far nobody seems to have hit on exactly what the criticism of arrogance is aimed at this is where the arrogance of christians arises many people believe that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the doctrines of christianity they are implicitly claiming that they are infallible and that there is no possibility of mistake claiming that you can not have made a mistake and that your thinking has led you to a flawless conclusion is pretty arrogant i agree with what darren has to say here but would like to add a personal observation what i see as arrogance and the problem i have with it is not a sense of personal certainty but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions clearly this is not just christian vs non christian there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within christianity i do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because like aesthetics it is not demonstable by objective means choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal sovereignty what bothers me is when others suggest that in these matters of faith their specific beliefs are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on others it follows from this that god must give everyone the same revelation of truth and thus anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path this is the arrogance i see a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and god even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others it is universalizing those matters of personal faith coupled by a proud notion that one s relationship with god is superior to other s that leads to arrogance in my honest and nonuniversal opinion darren f provine at the core of all well founded belief lies belief that is unfounded ludwig wittgenstein comments criticism welcome ken it is certainly reasonable to ask for some humility about our own ability to know the truth there are also different paths in some areas of practice but i d like to see more clarification about what you mean when you reject the idea of saying their specific beliefs are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on others if something is true it is true for everyone assuming that the belief is something about god history etc of course something of the form i believe that it s best for me not to xxx could be true for some people and not others i have suggested in the past that god may be less concerned about doctrinal agreement than many people are but that doesn t mean i doubt that there is a difference between true and false nor that i think there is no benefit in finding out what is true clh",1982

"from ronald w schmidt subject outlining of spline surface keywords spline rasterization lines about a year ago i started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult i am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and hopefully some published solutions to it the problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines for inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional i e only extant between the edges but which exists in three dimensional space to draw the object we fit a cubic spline through the points each spline is effectively computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the curve each spline has an equal number of segments we assume that the nth segment along each spline is roughly but not exactly the same distance along each spline by any reasonable measure take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the opposing spline use the pair of segments to form two triangles which will be filled in to color the surface depth sort the triangles take each triangle in sorted order project onto a d pixmap draw and color the triangle take the edge of the triangle that is along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge colored with a special edge color it is the edge coloring in step that is at the heart of the problem the idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface the net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface the reasons for this are fairly complicated they involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines if anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area thanks",1984

"from rashid subject re yet more rushdie re islamic law nntp posting host organization nh lines in article fred rice wrote it is my understanding that it is generally agreed upon by the ulema islamic scholars that islamic law applies only in an islamic country of which the uk is not furthermore to take the law into one s own hands is a criminal act as these are matters for the state not for individuals nevertheless khomeini offered a cash prize for people to take the law into their own hands something which to my understanding is against islamic law yes this is also my understanding of the majority of islamic laws however i believe there are also certain legal rulings which in all five schools of law sunni and jaffari can be levelled against muslim or non muslims both within and outside dar al islam i do not know if apostasy when accompanied by active persistent and open hostility to islam falls into this category of the law i do know that historically apostasy has very rarely been punished at all let alone by the death penalty my understanding is that khomeini s ruling was not based on the law of apostasy alone it was well known that rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the qur an hadith or in islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy i believe the charge levelled against rushdie was that of fasad this ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals the reward was not offered by khomeini but by individuals within iran stuff deleted also i think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that khomeini s fatwa was issued due to the _distribution_ of the book my understanding is that khomeini s fatwa was issued in response to the _writing_ and _publishing_ of the book if my view is correct then your viewpoint that rushdie was sentenced for a crime in progress is incorrect i would concur that the thrust of the fatwa from what i remember was levelled at the author and all those who assisted in the publication of the book however the charge of fasad can encompass a number of lesser charges i remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between britain and iran over the fatwa iran stressed that the condemnation of the author and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the crisis but you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people not books the rushdie situation was followed in iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa rushdie went on a media blitz presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book he was everywhere in the media then muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book rushdie appeared momentarily concerned then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the muslims and defend his sacred rights it was at this point that the fatwa on fasad was issued the fatwa was levelled at the person of rushdie any actions of rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling the book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers the fatwa against the person of rushdie encompasses his actions as well the crime was certainly a crime in progress at many levels and was being played out and played up in the the full view of the media p s i m not sure about this but i think the charge of shatim also applies to rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella of the fasad ruling",1986

"from petri pihko subject re is morality constant was re biblical rape organization university of oulu finland x newsreader tin version pl lines bill conner wrote there are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing an atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature exclusively this definition does not include all atheists see the faq however i for one do think there is no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanations it makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood as natural processes and to claim that our observations do not require us to postulate any divine intervention or anything spiritual for that matter humans are not omnipotent and neither is science however science has one advantage theology doesn t it is self correcting with nature as its judge it is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self consistent simple picture of our universe science is no longer a bunch of separate branches it is one from particle physics to psychology and no aspect of our life or our universe is safe from its stern and stony eye not even our consciousness there is no need for any recourse to divnity to describe or explain anything there is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics chemistry biology etc everything is random nothing is determnined actually determinism vs indeterminism is a philosophical question and science can not say whether the whole thing is actually somehow superdeterministic or not i think the question does not have any meaning as far as individual human beings go if their apparent free will is an illusion it does not appear to be so from their perspective bill can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free will or not this would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products there is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence it s just a happy accident maybe who are we to tell it seems intelligence is useful when during the history of earth has _one species_ been able to control one third of the whole biosphere this can still be a result of numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates and preserves even that machinery can be result of the same principle only the systems that can start replicating will survive those which don t don t make it recommended reading t o for an atheist no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense and no thought about an event can have value from whose perspective i value events and things subjectively from my perspective nature does not have values because it does not have a perspective values arise from awareness if i have a subjective perspective it is easy to assume that other people also do and if i think about what it would it be like in their position i will eventually discover the golden rule morality is not necessarily a gift from heavens in fact it may be a product of evolution perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity is helpful allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect others who seem to have identity too bill have you ever read aristotle try his ethica nikomakhea sp for starters how then can an atheist judge value what is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the bible or the purposes imputed to god on what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned it seems that in judging the values that motivate others to action you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured but what in nature can serve that purpose what law of nature can you invoke to establish your values c s lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why he abandoned his atheism and became christian the argument is severely flawed some values such as the golden rule can have a rational basis some others like the basic idea of wanting to live has probably its roots in the way our brains are wired lewis ignored the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour and morality as well indeed as humans evolved better and better in building and using tools they also became better at killing each other it is a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who knew how to use tools but not against one s own people the bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early jews was not beyond this a simple set of rules to hold the people together under one god their god did not care much about people of other nations at the time of the nt things were quite different the jews were under rule of an _empire_ and could no longer simply ignore the gentiles a new situation required a new morality and along with it a new religion was born a mutation in a meme pool since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event what difference could it possibly make what anyone does religious or otherwise there can be no meaning or gradation of value the only way an atheist can object to any behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he she just doesn t like it that s it any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any absolute sense it looks like you haven t bothered to read philosophy whenever there is an observer there is a subjective point of view which may value its existence and happiness even if that were just a result of some physical event and other s happiness too if the observer comes to think about it in an absolutely objective sense that is without any observers or subjects moral judgments lose their meaning it is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view this includes gods too their values are only _their_ personal judgments not absolute truths since such truths do not exist the fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence by becoming social beings who can think and value others existence morality is not property of humans alone chimps dolphins and many other species show great care for each other dolphins have sometimes saved humans from drowning a good deed indeed that you don t like what god told people to do says nothing about god or god s commands it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre existing thought set to form that reaction that your objections seem well founded is due to the way you ve been conditioned there is no truth content the whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion a virtual reality the last statement does not logically follow in fact there is every reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very well and our senses can convey reliable information solipsism is still a logical possibility but not a very likely one you are continuously mixing two different views the subjective point of view which we all share and an objective point of view _which does not exist_ any observer or thinker any personal being has its own point of view it does not matter whether this point of view is a result of some physical events or not it does not cease to be subjective from a non observers non point of view values do not exist neither does pain or pleasure or beauty or love such things are inherently subjective once again if god wants wives to submit to their husbands or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown or wants to punish us if we don t i disagree with his morals i do not think my morals come from any supreme being to remove my morals means the same than to make me a zombie a machine without a single thought if god gave us morality to judge but i disagree with him it is not my fault he is free to replace my morals i can not see what is the point of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one s own and then to get mad at this god must be schizophrenic all of this being so you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values right wrong goood evil etc and can not participate your opinion about the bible can have no weight whatsoever neither can the opinion of any god for that matter i can not understand why a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else bill take note absolute values must be independent of _any_ being _including_ gods if god has a subjective viewpoint it is his own point of view and his morals are his own petri ___ petri pihko mathematics is the truth ___ pihatie c finou oulu fi physics is

"from jay windley subject mormon temples organization university of utah cs dept lines mail server writes one thing i don t understand is why being sacred should make the temple rituals secret the so sacred it s secret explanation is a bit misleading while there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public but since public discussion is often irreverent most mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned but there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself granted the gnostic christians had their secret rituals but these seem to have been taken entirely from pagan pre christian mystery religions there are other interpretations to christian history in this matter one must recall that most of what we know about the gnostics was written by their enemies eusebius claims that jesus imparted secret information to peter james and john after his resurrection and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the twelve eusebius _historia ecclesiastica_ ii irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops _against heresies_ iv but eusebius disagrees he claims the secret ceremonies of the christian church perished with the apostles interestingly enough eusebius refers to the groups which we today call gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis eusebius op cit iii his gripe was not that thay professed a gnosis but that they had the wrong one writings dealing with jesus post resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately in one story simon magus opens a dialog with peter on the nature of god peter s response is you seem to me not to know what a father and a god is but i could tell you both whence souls are and when and how they were made but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you _clementine recognitions_ ii if any one theme underlies the _recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways i don t intend that everyone interpret christian history as i do but i believe that evidence exists favorably interpreted of course of early christian rites analogous to those practiced by mormons today neither new testament christianity nor biblical judaism made a secret of their practices but if judaism and christianity had such ceremonies would you expect to read about them in public documents one can search the book of mormon and other mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship yes you could establish that mormons worship in temples but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship on that basis can we conclude that the bible explains all practices which might have taken place and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist mormon scholar dr hugh nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which i have taken a few it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given matt all men can not receive this saying save they to whom it is given matt i have yet many things to say unto you but ye can not bear them now john the time cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i shall shew you plainly of the father john unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter cor many things i would not write with paper and ink but i come unto you and speak face to face jn nibley _since cumorah_ pp again these can also be interpreted many different ways i believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly i have heard that joseph smith took the entire practice i e both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual from the freemasons anybody in the know have any authoritative information on whether or not this claim is true historically joseph smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the freemasons there is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after smith became a mason it can be argued that smith had ample exposure to masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother hyrum a mason though no specific connection has yet been established my conversations with masons with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net have led me to believe that the connection from masonry to mormonism is fairly tenuous as our moderator notes most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony i believe that critics who charge that mormon rites were lifted from freemasonry do not have

"from mark baker subject re the arrogance of christians reply to mark baker organization the national capital freenet lines to what follows our moderator has already answered the charge of arrogance more ably that i could have done so so i will confine myself to answering the charge of illogic in a previous article geno says if i don t think my belief is right and everyone else s belief is wrong then i don t have a belief this is simply what belief means unfortunatly this seems to be how christians are taught to think when it comes to their religion this is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is or was taught to think it is the fundamental premis a is not not a if a thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false without this basic asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible we should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word believe however the weak sense means i am not sure i believe tom went to the library but he could have gone to the track the strong sense means i am so certain that i use it as a basis of thought i believe that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws despite the fact that nature appears capricious and unpredictable christian belief is of the strong kind though christians may well hold beliefs of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological topics some take it to the extreme and say that their religion is the only one and if you don t accept their teachings then you won t be saved note that these are two separate ideas most hold the first view but the majority do not hold the second is is again a matter of pure logic that if christanity is true then hinduism for example must necessarilly be false insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with christaianity and as a matter of logic vice versa it takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim to know what god thinks wants it is arrogant to claim to know what anyone thinks or wants unless they have told you christians believe god has told us what he thinks and wants especially when it s based upon your interpretation of a book most christians do not base their belief on the bible but on the living tradition of the church established by christ and guided constantly by the holy spirit the bible is simply the written core of that tradition the logic in the above statement is faulty in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can t both be correct if depends what you mean by differing if i believe tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs pounds our beliefs differ but we may both be right if i believe tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine one of us at least must be wrong it s all about perception no two people are exactly alike no two people perceive everything in the same way i believe that there is one truth call it god s truth a universal truth or call it what you will i don t believe god presents this truth i think it is just there and it s up to you to look for and see it through prayer meditation inspir ation dreams or whatever just because people may perceive this truth differently it doesn t mean one is wrong and the other is right thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being can find it you assert that anyone who believe that we can find absolute truth is mistaken in short you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong qed as an example take the question is the glass half empty or half full you can have two different answers which are contradictory and yet both are correct so for your belief to be true does not require everyone else s belief to be wrong here i begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth but simply with language saying that the glass is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half full it is the same fact expressed in different words the whole point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the same fact it is of course quite true that different people may express the same belief in different words it is also true that they may fail to understand each other s words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart great scisms have occurred in just this way and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief this does not mean in any sense that all beliefs are equally valid since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away some of the beliefs that some people hold must necessarilly be false and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so if i believe x and you believe y we may both be correct but if y is equivalent to not x then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs we must each regard the other as in error mark baker the task is not to cut down jungles but to irrigate deserts c s lewis",2168

"from subject re athiests and hell organization fnal ad net lines in article gerry palo writes between adam and eve and golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occurred this involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world this was precisely my point from a theological bent those who lived immediately after the flood such as noah ham his son cush and his son nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of divine wrath they also had a stronger understanding of the true god in fact this immediacy was a cause of hardship for some so much so that atlas who is seen with heavens resting on his shoulders but this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting it is to put god and the strict spirituality of his law at a distance and thus he became the elevator of the heavens this god made men able to feel as if heaven were afar off and as if either the god of heaven could not see through the dark cloud or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of his laws it is interesting to see that it was that was titled emancipator or deliverer or phoroneus it was nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system and abridged the liberties of mankind yet was worship for having given many benefits he was a deliverer all right but not as we think of christ as a deliverer one delivered from a conscious feeling of god s wrath the other actually performed a delivery from gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it as true the question of what happens to human beings who died before christ is an ever present one with christians i am not ready to consign adam or abraham or even cain to eternal damnation i don t see the problem from the time of adam those who looked forward to the coming anointed one and put their faith in the fact that it was god who was to do the provision were accounted as righteous but up to the crucifixion their sins were only covered not taken away therefore the dispensation of the church views the accountability of sin the same but see it as a completed action rom s makes it clear that it has always been salvation via faith and nothing else it is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment the relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of greenwich mean time i understand what you re trying to convey but i don t think i d lay hold of it because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of say the church ruling with christ jn tells us what eternal life is exactly as you are correct that it is much more than non cessation of consciousness it was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost it depends upon your def of lost the elect were lost only in time as outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world existentially we were all born lost but the righteous were in christ and therefore never assuredly lost it would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people s ideas of life after death maybe this summer i could find time to put together a paper on it i simply have to buy more books for myself and these older books are very expensive either that or countless trips to the oriental museum mankind fell into mist and darkness and at the turning point of time a new light entered into the world the light still grows and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it much new revelation and growth in under standing lies before us our new vision and understanding is still very feeble but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well couldn t agree with you more our understanding of say eschatology is clearly clearer than that of say isaiah but that is not what i was referring to at this point i should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of rudolf steiner founder of anthroposophy for many insights that have led me to my views on this subject the way you refer to it as doctrine puts a modern intellectual coloring on it i think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received no i understand it as you have said this was my point i am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source even if they were passed on the question is to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience ah this is it this is the big question however i would say again i think that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it look at satan s twist of god s word when he coerced eve that is a very interesting study the similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people s ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality yes that is my point but it is a two edged sword for some do not want the underlying reality to be revealed they were not known as mystery religions for no reason there was the public side of them and there was the private side that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they revealed that private side that is why it is so hard to bring their teachings to light the mystery of iniquity that we find in the bible correlates to this i think the primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately little by little under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath what it would not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion case in point today might be the masons just a note that they too worshipped osiris in egypt who can be traced to nimrod the husband son on the other hand there is one notion firmly embedded in christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source the idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only and that the soul is created at birth was consciously adopted from aristotle whose ideas dominated christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today no i disagree with you here gerry i know what you re alluding to in that the church primarily the rcc did endorse aristotelian philosophy into their worldview but i would disagree with you that it originated in greece if you are a student of history you will come to see that much of what greece came to expound to the world as their original was just an adulteration of that which they had taken from conquered countries the soul is clearly mentioned and discussed at length in the egyptian religions as was the unity of god and also the trinity of god see if you can find wilkinson s egyptians he really does a number on what the greeks did to what they pilfered from the egyptians he was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim i m not knocking aristotle or plato or any other greek thinker its just that there is nothing new under the sun indeed i should also clarify that i do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is a real possibility but the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment i e after the end of a single earthly life is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality and i think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out each age has its own focus of theology the early church struggled with the trinitarian formulation the reformation dealt with authority today eschatology has had much study the early creeds do not spell these things out in detail because they weren t the topic of concern there was insufficient wisdom accumulated they didn t have the exegetical tools that we have today also

last the weather should be cooperative we hope to see a very large gathering to welcome dr teperman wednesday april k of c uniondale last meeting it has been noted here before that the long island chapter of trio has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather being able to forecast rain sleet and snow fully a month in advance no tv weatherman can match us this time we not only scored again but we were also able to disable the long island railroad making travel really difficult none the less many braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good conversation our scheduled speaker mrs elizabeth linnehan a professional nutritionist had a family emergency and was not able to attend she hope she will be with us in the fall to discuss diet and medications however ms jennifer friedman an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient was kind enough to step in on very short notice ms friedman gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup even a bit for men to help us look well and healthy and to minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine and drugs we take we are most grateful to jennifer and thank her for an entertaining evening annual meeting in addition to welcoming dr teperman the april meeting is also the annual meeting of the chapter this is the official notice of the meeting as required by our by laws the main purpose of the meeting is to review the past year solicit member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs and to elect members of the board of directors for the coming two year term the nominating committee has prepared the following slate for the board anne liver recipient and don treffeisen robert heart recipient and eulene smith vito kidney recipient and bette suglia

membership reports will be given and the floor will be open for any new business suggestions or comments anyone would like to bring up we will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the

to soda send me e mail and we ll see what we can arrange general info on injuries first and foremost of importance if you experience pain at all then you absolutely need to go see a doctor as soon as you possibly can the difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long drawn out ordeal go see a doctor now your garden variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury generally any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems don t wait though go see a doctor the remainder of this information is paraphrased without permission from a wonderful report by new zealand s department of labour occupational safety and health service occupational overuse syndrome treatment and rehabilitation a practitioner s guide first a glossary or fancy names for how you shouldn t have your hands note you re likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors rsi repetitive strain injury a general term for many kinds of injuries oos occupational overuse syndrome synonym for rsi ctd cumulative trauma disorder another synonym for rsi wruld work related upper limb disorders yet another synonym for rsi cts carpal tunnel syndrome see below hyperextension marked bending at a joint pronation turning the palm down wrist extension bending the wrist up supination turning the palm up wrist flexion bending the wrist down pinch grip the grip used for a pencil ulnar deviation bending the wrist towards the little finger power grip the grip used for a hammer radial deviation bending the wrist toward the thumb abduction moving away from the body overspanning opening the fingers out wide now then problems come in two main types local conditions and diffuse conditions local problems are what you d expect specific muscles tendons tendon sheaths nerves etc being inflamed or otherwise hurt diffuse conditions often mistaken for local problems can involve muscle discomfort pain burning and or tingling with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles although they re not necessarily the problem why does occupational overuse syndrome occur here s the theory normally your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers when you tense a muscle you restrict the blood flow by the time you re exerting of your full power you re completely restricting your blood flow without fresh blood your muscles use stored energy until they run out then they switch to anaerobic without oxygen metabolism which generates nasty by products like lactic acid which cause pain once one muscle hurts all its neighbors tense up perhaps to relieve the load this makes sense for your normal sort of injury but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion more tension means less blood flow and the cycle continues another by product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves they need blood too anyway when you re typing too much you re never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through stress poor posture and poor ergonomics only make things worse specific injuries you may have heard of note most injuries come in two flavors acute and chronic acute injuries are severely painful and noticable chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real tenosynovitis an inflamation of the tendon sheath chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent not enough to cause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheath s ability to lubricate the tendon as a result the tendon sheath thickens gets inflamed and you ve got your problem tendonitis an inflammation of a tendon repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation eventually the fibers of the tendon start separating and can even break leaving behind debris which induces more friction more swelling and more pain sub acute tendonitis is more common which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it gets worse with repetitive activity carpal tunnel syndrome the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them symptoms include feeling pins and needles tingling numbness and even loss of sensation cts is often confused for a diffuse condition adverse mechanical tension also known as neural tension this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere amt can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other oos disorders it is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy others for just about every part of your body there s a fancy name for a way to injure it by now you should be getting an idea of how oos conditions occur and why just be careful many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as carpal tunnel syndrome when in reality you may have a completely different problem always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you like surgery typing posture ergonomics prevention treatment the most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons this requires learning how to relax if you re under a load of stress this is doubly important tune out the world and breath deep and regular relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work every three minutes take a three second break every three minutes take a three second break really do it every three minutes it s also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings calm down and relax if you can t sleep you really need to focus on this rest sleep and relaxation are really a big deal there are all kinds of other treatments of course drugs can reduce inflamation and pain custom molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture surgery can fix some problems exercise can help strengthen your muscles regular stretching can help prevent injury good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension ice or hot cold contrast baths also reduce swelling only your doctor can say what s best for you posture here are some basic guidelines i so liked the way this was written in the new zealand book that i m lifting it almost verbatim from appendix dwallach let your shoulders relax let your elbows swing free keep your wrists straight pull your chin in to look down don t flop your head forward keep the hollow in the base of your spine try leaning back in the chair don t slouch or slump forward alter your posture from time to time every minutes get up and bend your spine backward set the seat height first your feet should be flat on the floor there should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees and your thighs should not slope too much now draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at if you are short this may be impossible the beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest now adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan the backrest should support you in the hollow of your back so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area if you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time leaning back so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if available now i diverge a little from the text a good chair makes a big difference if you don t like your chair go find a better one you really want adjustments for height back angle back height and maybe even seat tilt most arm rests seem to get in the way although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way you should find a good store and play with all these chairs pick one that s right for you in the san francisco bay area i highly recommend just chairs the name says it all keyboard drawers wrist pads and keyboard replacements there is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right for some people wrist pads seem to work wonders however with good posture you shouldn t be resting your wrists on anything you would prefer your keyboard to be right there if you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about degrees of course you want to avoid pronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all costs wrist pads may or may not help at this you should get somebody else to come and look at how you work how you sit how you type and how you relax it s often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands some argue that the normal flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed a number of replacements are available on the market today check out the accompanying typing injury faq keyboards for much detail requests for more info clearly the above information is incomplete the typing injury archive is incomplete there s always more information out there if you d like to submit something please send me mail and i ll gladly throw it in if you d like to maintain a list of products or vendors that would be wonderful i d love somebody to make a list of chair desk vendors i d love somebody to make a list of doctors i d love somebody to edit the above sections looking for places where i ve
